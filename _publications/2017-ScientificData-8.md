## Abstract
The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from independent patients and sources holds considerable promise to improve the understanding of development and disease. However, optimized use of iPSC depends on our ability to develop methods to efficiently qualify cell lines and protocols, monitor genetic stability, and evaluate self-renewal and differentiation potential. To accomplish these goals, 57 stem cell lines from 10 laboratories were differentiated to 7 different states, resulting in 248 analyzed samples. Cell lines were differentiated and characterized at a central laboratory using standardized cell culture methodologies, protocols, and metadata descriptors. Stem cell and derived differentiated lines were characterized using RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, copy number arrays, DNA methylation arrays, flow cytometry, and molecular histology. All materials, including raw data, metadata, analysis and processing code, and methodological and provenance documentation are publicly available for re-use and interactive exploration at https://www.synapse.org/pcbc. The goal is to provide data that can improve our ability to robustly and reproducibly use human pluripotent stem cells to understand development and disease.
