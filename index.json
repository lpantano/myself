This post uses the original “custom commands” terminology from the video.\nThe Problem: Inconsistent Paper Reviews I review hundreds of scientific papers for the Health Integrity Project. We evaluate health claims—things you hear everywhere, like “Red raspberry leaf shortens labor”—and determine if scientific evidence supports them.\nThe challenge? Consistency.\nManual reviews take 30 minutes to 2 hours per paper. I might check for conflicts of interest thoroughly in one review, then forget in the next. Focus on statistical methods in one paper, skip bias assessment in another. My criteria shift paper to paper.\nThis inconsistency doesn’t just waste time—it undermines scientific validity. If evaluation criteria change between papers, the entire project loses credibility.\nThe Solution: Claude Custom Commands Claude custom commands tell the AI model exactly how to handle a specific task. I created a command that runs the same evaluation workflow every single time.\nThe workflow asks:\nAre there conflicts of interest? Is this a valid study type (not narrative reviews)? Is the control group adequate? What biases exist? Do results align with the claim? Each paper goes through identical steps. Nothing gets skipped.\nHow It Works A custom command is a markdown file in your project folder (.claude/commands/). Mine is called review-paper.md.\nBasic Structure Every custom command has three parts:\nInput: What you provide Task: What Claude should do Output format: How results should look Here’s the minimal markdown structure:\n# Command Name ## Input - Item 1 (e.g., paper location) - Item 2 (e.g., claim to evaluate) ## Task Step-by-step instructions for Claude to follow ## Output Format How you want results structured My Paper Review Workflow ## Step 1: Validation Screen - Check conflict of interest - Identify study type - Flag narrative reviews or meta-analyses - Output: VALID or INVALID with reasons ## Step 2: Quality Assessment - Evaluate control groups - Assess statistical methods - Identify biases - Output: Quality rating with evidence ## Step 3: Result Alignment - Compare study results to claim - Determine if supporting or contradicting - Output: Category recommendation Real Example: Raspberry Leaf Study I run the command: /review-paper\nClaude asks for:\nPaper location Claim being evaluated Paper position (supporting or contradicting) I provide:\nPaper: raspberry-study.pdf Claim: “Red raspberry leaf shortens labor and helps induce birth” Position: Supporting Claude starts the evaluation:\nStep 1 Results:\nFunding: Company involvement noted, but primary funding independent Study type: Human clinical trial (valid) No narrative meta-analysis Status: Proceed to quality check Step 2 Results:\nControl group: Present Statistical methods: Adequate sample size, appropriate tests Biases: Selection bias possible (self-reported outcomes) Step 3 Results:\nStudy results: No significant difference in labor duration Alignment with claim: CONTRADICTS Category: Misinformation (claim unsupported by results) At each step, I can interact: “Dig deeper into selection bias” or “Show exact quote about labor duration from paper.”\nBeyond Paper Reviews Custom commands work for any repeated workflow.\nExample for bioinformatics:\nCommand: /optimize-nextflow Input: Pipeline directory Task: 1. Analyze resource usage from execution reports 2. Calculate actual vs requested CPU/memory 3. Ignore failed jobs 4. Generate updated resource config 5. Optional: Update nextflow.config Output: Resource optimization recommendations Why This Matters Time savings: Reviews that took 1-2 hours now take 30 minutes.\nConsistency: Same questions, same order, every paper.\nThoroughness: Nothing gets forgotten or skipped.\nTransparency: The workflow is documented and repeatable.\nThe custom command doesn’t replace my judgment—it retrieves information and ensures I evaluate every paper the same way. I still make final decisions. I still dig deeper when needed.\nWhat custom commands can’t do: Make subjective quality judgments, understand context outside the paper, or catch every nuance in complex statistical methods. They work best for structured, repeatable workflows where the steps are clear.\nBut I never miss conflict of interest checks again. I never forget to assess control groups. The baseline evaluation happens consistently.\nGetting Started Find a workflow you repeat frequently Document the steps Define input, task, and output format Create a markdown file in .claude/commands/ Test and refine Start simple. Even basic workflows benefit from automation.\nThe goal isn’t to hand everything to AI. It’s to ensure your systematic processes stay systematic.\nResources:\nHealth Integrity Project - Evidence-based health claim evaluation Claude Custom Commands/skills Documentation - How to create your own commands Health Integrity Review Workflow - Our paper evaluation process Have you tried custom …","date":1769616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1769616000,"objectID":"2c02e1fd265580ca33bb995fc5a46116","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/post/2026/2026-01-28-claude-custom-commands-paper-review/","publishdate":"2026-01-28T12:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2026/2026-01-28-claude-custom-commands-paper-review/","section":"post","summary":"Custom AI commands ensure consistent scientific paper reviews.

Now you need to check alignment quality. Do you really have to download everything to run IGV locally? Switch virtual machines to load the files? Write code to generate static visuals?\nThis integration brings IGV directly to your cloud workspace with automatic track discovery. It scans your storage, finds all genomic files, and presents them in a ready-to-load menu. No downloads, no file paths, no manual configuration.\nThe Workflow Gap Analysis happens in the cloud. Fast compute, scalable storage, pipelines that finish overnight.\nVisualization happens separately or requires coding. Manual downloads or transfers, disk space constraints, waiting for transfers to complete, changing environments.\nThis gap slows iteration. It wastes time. And it’s fixable.\nWhat Cloud-Native Visualization Looks Like I built an integration that runs IGV as a web app directly in Seqera workspaces. It connects to the same cloud storage your pipelines write to. It automatically discovers all genomic files. Zero downloads, zero manual file loading.\nOther solutions exist—desktop IGV in Studios or Python notebooks for programmatic visualization. These work, but they’re not seamless. Desktop IGV still requires manual file path configuration. Notebooks require coding for every view. This approach eliminates both friction points.\nHow It Works The container combines IGV web app with Seqera’s connect-client. The connect-client uses FUSE to mount cloud storage, making remote files appear local to IGV.\nA startup script scans mounted directories for genomic files—BAM, CRAM, VCF, BED, BigWig, anything IGV can read. It detects file formats, checks for index files, and generates a track catalog. IGV reads this catalog and populates a custom “Auto-discovered Tracks” menu.\nThe visualization tool comes to where data already lives.\nWhat This Looks Like in Practice Launch the IGV Studio from your Seqera interface. Your browser opens with the IGV web app.\nClick Tracks → Auto-discovered Tracks. See a table of all your BAM files, VCF variants, coverage tracks—everything in your mounted storage.\nClick to load. Instant visualization.\nWhy This Matters Skip the download/coding wait. Checking alignments after a pipeline run no longer means waiting to transfer data or coding.\nStop duplicating storage. No local copies means hundreds of GB saved per researcher.\nShare results faster. Send a browser URL instead of transferring massive files.\nOnboard easier. New team members don’t need complex local setups. They click a link and start viewing data.\nImprove reproducibility. Everyone views the same authoritative data source in cloud storage, not their own potentially outdated local copies.\nGetting Started Important context: This solution is specifically for Seqera Platform users. If you’re using other platforms like Terra, AnVIL, Galaxy, or DNAnexus, they have their own approaches to interactive visualization. This implementation leverages Seqera’s Studios feature and connect-client architecture.\nThe full implementation is open source in the Seqera custom studios examples repository. You’ll find:\nComplete Dockerfile with multi-stage build Automatic track discovery script Deployment documentation Configuration examples Maturity note: This is a proof of concept tested on several datasets. It demonstrates the pattern and should help you get started, but expect to adapt it for production use. Test thoroughly with your own data and file structures.\nThe code is customizable. Adapt the track discovery logic for your file naming conventions. Change the reference genome. Add authentication if needed.\nThe Broader Pattern Cloud-native analysis means rethinking entire workflows, not just moving compute. Bringing visualization to cloud data is part of that shift.\nOther platforms (Terra, AnVIL) mount cloud storage for interactive apps too. What makes this useful is the automatic track discovery—most solutions require manual file paths.\nThe less time you spend moving data around, the more time you spend understanding it.\nReferences:\nRobinson JT, et al.

Orange zone. Again.\nMy cadence sat around 157 steps per minute. The color warned me something was off. Too slow. Below average. Less experienced.\nBut I felt fine. No pain. Sustainable pace with moderate effort. So what was the problem?\nI dug into Garmin’s manual to find out. I discovered that, again, I was missing a lot of context to understand this metric.\nThe Colors Are Percentile Rankings Here’s what Garmin’s cadence zones actually mean:\nPurple (\u0026gt;183 spm): Top 5% of all Garmin users Blue (174-183 spm): 70th-95th percentile Green (164-173 spm): 30th-69th percentile (“average”) Orange (153-163 spm): 5th-29th percentile (“less experienced or slower”) Red (\u0026lt;153 spm): Bottom 5% My orange zone meant I ranked in the 5th-29th percentile compared to other Garmin users.\nNot that my cadence was wrong for my body. Not that I was injured or inefficient. Just that most other Garmin users run with higher cadence.\nThese aren’t personalized to your body. They’re fixed thresholds based on population data. The same thresholds apply whether you’re 5\u0026#39;4\u0026#34; or 6\u0026#39;4\u0026#34;, running easy or racing, experienced or brand new.\nThe zones compare you to everyone else. They don’t tell you what’s optimal for you.\nWhat Research Actually Shows I kept digging. Here’s what the research says about cadence:\nHalf of Cadence Is Just You Researchers modeled cadence using leg length, running speed, weight, age, and running experience in 138 youth long-distance runners. These factors explained only 48-55% of the variation between runners (Taylor-Haas et al., 2022, Gait \u0026amp; Posture).\nThe other ~50%? Unmeasurable individual factors unique to each person—likely including tendon stiffness, muscle fiber length, and muscle group strength patterns that can’t be easily measured.\nElite ultramarathon runners show this clearly. A 2019 study of the top finishers at a 100-km World Championship found cadences ranging from 155 to 203 steps per minute—an average of 182 spm (Burns et al., 2019, Journal of Applied Physiology).\nSame performance level. 48-step difference in cadence.\nHeight and Leg Length Matter The same study found that leg length and running speed together explained approximately 50% of cadence variance (Taylor-Haas et al., 2022). Shorter leg lengths and faster running speeds were both associated with higher cadence.\nThe numbers:\nEvery inch of height = ~3 fewer steps per minute A 6-foot runner naturally takes ~18 fewer steps per minute than a 5\u0026#39;6\u0026#34; runner Longer legs = lower leg stiffness = naturally lower cadence Researchers even created a formula: Cadence = -1.251 × Leg Length (cm) + 3.665 × Speed (m/s) + 254.858\nCalculate your expected cadence:\nLeg Length (cm): Measure from hip joint to floor while standing Running Speed (m/s): Easy pace: 2.0-2.5 m/s | Tempo: 3.0-3.5 m/s | Race: 3.5+ m/s Calculate\nYour Expected Cadence: Remember, about 50% of cadence variance comes from leg length and running speed. The rest is individual. And this formula comes from one paper and is a guide to help you understand how different factors can affect cadence.\nSpeed Changes Your Cadence Your cadence at easy pace differs from your cadence at tempo pace. Obviously.\nA 2025 study of 30 experienced recreational runners (running 24+ km/week) examined how cadence changed with running speed. The study confirmed that increasing speed directly increases cadence (Leacox et al., 2025, International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy).\nSame runners. Different paces. Different cadences. But there were some exceptions where runners did not increase cadence after a certain point, even as speed increased.\nGarmin’s zones don’t distinguish between easy runs and hard efforts. An orange zone on an easy day doesn’t mean the same thing as orange on a tempo run.\nHere’s my association between cadence and speed. The correlation is clear, though there’s still variability at the same cadence. I ran in different terrains, different shoes, while sick, and while feeling fine.\nThe 180 Myth Lives On You’ve probably heard it: 180 steps per minute is the “ideal” cadence.\nGarmin’s purple zone starts at 183 spm, and mentions it in the explanatory text of the graph as an ideal target.\nI won’t dive into the full story of where 180 came from—that would take us down a rabbit hole of observations, elite athletes, and how one number became running gospel. But here’s what matters: research shows it doesn’t apply to everyone.\nElite ultramarathoners performing at the same level run with cadences ranging from 155 to 203 steps per minute (Burns et al., 2019). That’s a 48-step difference. Same performance. Wildly different cadences.\nThe 180 rule came from watching elite runners at race pace. Not recreational runners. Not easy pace. Not different body types.\nYet somehow it became the standard everyone chases.\nWhat This Means for You Ignore the colors.\nOrange doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong.

I was lucky to be joined by two brilliant next-gen scientists, Francince Camacho and Saba Nafees. Follow them—they’re going to be incredible leaders and influencers in our field and beyond.\nThe session was private, intentionally, to create a safe space where we could speak openly. That setup mattered. I’ve been advocating for equal opportunities since I started in science 15 years ago, and this discussion hit close to home. It’s a topic I never get tired of thinking about—because each time, I learn something new.\nBefore diving into my takeaways, I want to give a big shout-out to the Nextflow Summit. It was one of the most welcoming events I’ve attended: committed to diversity, showcasing a wide range of voices (check out the speakers and keynotes!), and even organizing a hackathon with enough women to make me feel right at home—which, believe me, is rare in tech spaces. It’s such a relief to be in a room and not feel like you’re the only one representing a group.\nHere’s something I want to be clear about: we don’t need any kind of special treatment to be in this field. Bioinformatics doesn’t come with a gender requirement. What we do need is equal treatment.\nThe reasons some of us don’t come back to conferences or workplaces? It’s not complicated. Sexual comments (which somehow still happen and are still not funny), being talked over, or hearing one of our ideas repeated back to us—by someone else claiming it as their own. Yep, that still happens.\nWe no longer need to prove that diversity makes science better—there’s already plenty of research on that. Honestly, we all just want a fair shot. Equal opportunities to work hard and be recognized. If you don’t see the inequality, that’s okay, but science has shown it’s real. Yes, things have improved. But leadership roles are still very male-dominated see LeanIn.org for stats. I won’t go into a long rant—but if you think there’s a reason beyond unconscious bias or unequal opportunities to explain this gap, I dare you: send me a scientifically backed explanation. I’m all ears.\nAt this point, you might be feeling one of a few things:\nYou’re a man—maybe even a white man—and you’ve had a hard time too, maybe even felt discriminated against. First, I’m sorry. That sucks, and I know what that feels like. But that doesn’t mean your experience is representative of the average. On average, women still face more barriers. Let’s work together so that no one gets left out or mistreated. You’re a man who’s never seen any of this happen. Great—happy for you! Now go ask your female coworkers what they’ve experienced. This all makes sense to you. Or… you think this is all BS and everything’s fine. If that’s the case, you’ve probably stopped reading by now. So what can we do?\nThere’s one simple, powerful thing every ally can do—and if even 1 in 5 people with privilege did it, things would improve fast:\nAt work, be a good colleague to a woman. Then ask her, “How can I support your career?” And then—try to do it.\nThat’s it. You’d be surprised how little it takes to make a big difference. But I’ll be honest—it might not be “comfortable.” You might have to stand up in front of other colleagues. And then two things will happen:\nSome coworkers will join you. Others might see you as that person—an annoying advocate—and you may lose a bit of their privileged support. This is where it gets real. You’ll have to choose: what kind of career, and what kind of world, do you want to help build?\nBut here’s the thing: the more people who speak up, the less risky it becomes for any one person. Quiet support and private “likes” aren’t enough anymore. We need action. Especially from men. Now more than ever.\nNo one has ever asked me how they could help support my career. Not once.\nSo if you’re one of the people deciding to do something—thank you. Really. Welcome to the community. Let’s keep moving forward, together.\n","date":1747756800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1747756800,"objectID":"a462fce834e76d1f555dac6eb826ff23","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/post/2025/2025-05-diversity-panel/","publishdate":"2025-05-20T12:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2025/2025-05-diversity-panel/","section":"post","summary":"Last Friday, I had the chance to join a panel discussion on advancing diversity in challenging times.

Advancements in sequencing technologies, including single-cell and spatial biology, have transformed biological research approaches. The increasing volume and complexity of sequencing data necessitate automated, scalable infrastructure for reproducible data processing and analysis. Platforms like Nextflow and nf-core have democratized access to primary sequencing analysis through standardized, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. Specialized bioinformatics cores have become essential in supporting researchers, providing expertise in statistical analysis and interpretation. The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core, for example, analyzes numerous projects annually, contributing to publications and offering consultations on experimental design and methodology. While data pre-processing has become more standardized, researchers often struggle with complex study designs and appropriate bioinformatics methods. The bcbio-reports project aims to streamline downstream data analysis by providing report templates for various data types and analyses in a single resource. This infrastructure standardizes downstream multi-omic data analysis, allowing researchers to focus on interpretation and biological understanding. The vision of bcbio emphasizes quantifiability, community development, reproducibility, accessibility, portability, and cutting-edge methodologies.

This time, it was about subsampling raw sequencing data. In my group, we’ve been doing this for ages: copy-pasting an SBATCH script, loading the necessary modules, tweaking the code, submitting it to the cluster, and then closely monitoring it. It usually gets the job done.\nBut, we’re living in exciting times! With tools like Nextflow, Seqera, and Seqera AI, I decided to take a leap and harness the power of Seqera AI to create a small Nextflow pipeline for processing fastq files and generating subsampled outputs. Within just 30 minutes, I managed to build a pipeline using the seqtk nfcore/module, complete with test data, and config files that enabled Docker compatibility and execution within our Seqera Workspace. Okay, full disclosure, someone else on the team actually ran the pipeline, what makes this even a better example of accesibility.\nOf course, AI didn’t do all the work for me; it simply kick-started the process. As someone who knows a thing or two about development, I was able to troubleshoot and refine what the AI initially provided. The pipeline did run, but we hit a snag with jobs failing due to memory constraints. It turned out our output files were pretty hefty, so I delved into the tool’s parameters and quickly adjusted the necessary config settings. Problem solved!\nThis experience is a testament to how we can speed up analyses without sacrificing reproducibility or accessibility. And thanks to Seqera, pinpointing the memory issue was a breeze. I genuinely believe adopting such tools will lower the barriers to creating small or infrequent projects and ultimately improve our research. So, why not give your own small pipeline a shot?\nAnd yes, this post got a little help from Harvard Open AI GPT-4 to bring it to you.\n","date":1732204800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732204800,"objectID":"06454b628bdc751e6f496d63b008347e","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/post/2024/nextflow_seqera_ai_in_30min/","publishdate":"2024-11-21T12:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2024/nextflow_seqera_ai_in_30min/","section":"post","summary":"Example of automation with miniaml investment but good results","tags":[],"title":"Showcase: My Quick Dive into Pipeline Automation with Seqera AI","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Visualization"],"content":"Overview An interactive dashboard built with React.js that visualizes personal training data from Apple Health and Garmin Connect apps.

Do you value their work and relationship? Answer these questions and I will tell you: Have you ever generated data without talking to a CBS and then had a meeting to tell them what you need and what to do? Have you ever met with a CBS to tell them the figure you want or the analysis you wish for without discussing the scientific hypothesis? Have you ever made a timeline or assured delivery of a project that involves analysis of a CBS team without discussing it deeply with them?\nIf you answer YES to any of that, then you are not appreciating Computational Biology scientists (I know it isn’t what you mean) and you are making your life more difficult. Not only that, but your projects are NOT efficiently executed, and there will be a lot of frustration and delays because of not talking to us first.\nBut it is EASY to change. Next time you think you need to generate any high-throughput data, before even planning the experiment, start meeting with the CBS team. Explain your scientific hypothesis or question, and ask us: Do you know any technology to generate data that will support or not this hypothesis? What are the key aspects we need to think about for the experimental design? What resources do you need? What limitations do you see? Computational biologists are not a Microsoft Office Suite for other fields. We understand the technologies that generate the data we analyze. For instance, there is nothing simple about RNAseq. There are more than 60 steps from your cells to raw data, and there are more than 50 computational methods applied to the data to get you the best gene expression estimation. Protocols get cheaper, shorter and automated, but they are still COMPLEX. The analysis gets faster and cheaper, but they are still COMPLEX. Not because you don’t see it, it is not there.

In 2011, in response to the absence of a globally adaptable workflow manager at the time, Brad Chapman began developing Bcbio, a Python-based NGS workflow manager, for the Core. Bcbio, which synthesizes insights learned from numerous projects to provide best-practice workflows, gained traction within and beyond the Core and has been embraced by academic researchers, hospitals, and industry alike. Continuously adapting to meet the evolving demands of diverse infrastructure architectures, Bcbio has faced the ongoing challenge of remaining current and adaptable. Over the past five years, the nf-core community has harnessed the capabilities of Nextflow as a workflow manager, fostering the creation of an international, open-source ecosystem supporting over 50 pipelines. As ambassadors of analysis reproducibility and scalability, the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core recognizes the imperative of transitioning to nf-core, albeit a complex process in our organization. In this presentation, we outline the rationale behind this migration, elucidate the challenges we are encountering, and delineate our roadmap toward community-wide adoption, drawing upon our experiences with the Bcbio platform.","tags":[],"title":"Lorena Pantano: Transitioning through the nf-core era at the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"And here we go again, after 5 years working in early-stage companies, I decided to share what I learned about building an infrastructure that works for the needs of a small company. Note, that there won’t be a unique solution to this, and depending on the data input throughput the strategy will change. A good introduction to DataOmics and why this is important can be found at Hammerspace in an interview with Eleanor Howe.\nBefore I start, many other great experts have already talked about this, I learned from them and applied much of what they have said: Michele Busby, and recently from Jack Lindamood.\nNow some context, because context matters. I built everything from scratch at NextRNA. This company focused on targeting lncRNA-protein interactions with small molecules to expand the therapy landscape in oncology and neurodegeneration. The data we use is mainly RNAseq, since we are focusing on detecting lncRNA drivers. We have to internalize raw data from big studies like TCGA and similar, to re-analyze it with our pipeline and annotation.\nAWS cloud services are what is working for us, and it helps us to be stable.\nNetwork: we have two VPCs, with two subnets (private and public). We only use the private subnet and we connect to them through the VPN Client services and with the VPN tunnels to our office. All machines have specific group security configurations to allow only the machine-to-machine communication we know will happen. This can be painful, but it will keep you aware of what is accessible. One VPC is dedicated to shared servers ( I will talk later about this), and another, to machines that will be created through the Batch service, you can call it our HPC space. Storage: we use mainly S3, we have different buckets depending on data usage policies. We store controlled data that needs to follow specific data usage agreements with NIH. We have permanent processed data and raw data with different storage classes to make it more cost-effective. We have an EFS that is mounted on our shared servers, so every temporary data that we need meanwhile we run downstream data analyses can be accessed from different applications. Some of this data is not temporary but is small and need fast access by Web-Apps, so we keep it here instead of S3. Shared Servers: we decided to go with the now-name Posit Bundle: workbench, connect and package manager. This together with our shared file system has made my team collaboration very efficient. About the software, we use all the same R version, with the same R packages. This ensures reproducibility. We decide as a team, the time to update to the next R version and what are the migration steps needed for this. This allows us to publish visualization tools very easily as well, and it has fostered the relationship with the other groups in the company. Nothing gives me more joy than seeing my team talking every day with colleagues from other groups. Pipelines: The biggest contribution to our better efficiency has been using Seqera platform together with NextFlow pipelines. I will always go with this, it makes it so easy to know what is going on, help debug, relaunch pipelines… And there are features we are not using yet that will make many other processes easier, like datasets ready to be analyzed at any point, visualizing reports, spin-off on-demand machines… GitHub: this is not new, but I want to share how we use it. We decided on some naming conventions for repositories, have templates repositories, and have documentation in the repository. Have a company internal package that collects all the common code that is used now and then, so we make sure that repetitive analyses of data are the same, and anybody can work on them. As well we have our figure theme so we are consistent when we create reports. We use it a lot for BD material creation. Finally, even if it is not part of the computing infrastructure, I would say managing projects efficiently is important. We tried different things, but what worked the best was Trello. We decided on a protocol on what a card would mean, how to annotate the card, how to see the workload of the team only by looking at the Trello board…and it worked like magic. We have a weekly meeting to align on the short-term goals and long-term goals and plan accordingly.\nOther solutions I know they will be good but I couldn’t explore more because of time constraints and budget limitations. For instance, Code Ocean. I know about Deep Origin, it would be more like an advanced software as a service but it could be part of the overall infrastructure to accelerate the time between data and decision. Similar companies, like BigOmics helps to analyze data quickly without thinking on the backend. BioBox is working in new products as well, this one focused on graph data representation.\nMore focused on data, I would evaluate TileDB and Databricks when the time is right and the amount of data and integration are a limitation to your process.

I didn’t know anything about this cancer, and I discovered how horrible it is, even if treatment is available, people get misdiagnosed all the time, and there is no cure. I am doing the marathon this year with the Jimmy fund walk event. NextRNA, the company I work for, joined as a team, and it gave me the opportunity to do something and share my story to bring awareness.\nPlease, if you can, add a few $$ to my fund-raising page: http://danafarber.jimmyfund.org/goto/lopantano, and/or share the link with friends. Any amount will impact people like my mom.\nJune 18, 6 miles Chapter 01: September 2022, my mom started with some back pain and started to lose mobility. She stopped doing her normal activity.\nJune 24, 7.5 miles Chapter 02: One month later, doctors only gave her pain medication, all kinds, nothing was working, and she was not able to walk or sit. The health system denied her any kind of imaging to evaluate further.\nJuly 1, 9 miles Chapter 03: November 2022, my mom was getting worse, not able to move at all, and starting to lose short-term memory and not able to maintain a normal conversation. After a lot of push from my dad, they got a referral from primary care to get an MRI in a private clinic. We needed to wait for 1 more week now.\nJuly 8, 10.5 miles Chapter 04: In December 2022, my mom got accepted into the hospital after having results from the MRI that showed some kind of cancer inside the bones. She had broken discs and ribs. In one day we knew it was MM, protein M levels were incredibly high. At this point, she was spending all the time in bed. She was disoriented. I bought a ticket to Spain right away.\nJuly 15, 12 miles Chapter 05: Still in December 2022, I arrived there to see my mom in bed and told me not to touch her too hard because it hurts…my heart broke. It was late, so I went to bed. The next morning I saw my mom standing up, so weak. That weak was all about finding new ways to make her more comfortable. She couldn’t sit for more than 20 minutes, she could barely eat. It was week two of chemotherapy and nausea was a strong side effect.\nJuly 22, 13.4 miles Chapter 06: Still in December 2022, we were figuring out everything still. In her third week of chemotherapy, she got a strong reaction to the skin. She was red all over the belly. It was scary, and her PCP didn’t want to give her anything because she didn’t know what could happen with her treatment. The PCP told us to go to her oncologist. But, and big BUT, the system is not ready to contact your oncologist. Your option is to go to ER and spend 6 hours until somebody decides if they contact the oncologist. I had to go with my dad to the hospital and intercept her oncologist in the corridor. But we didn’t find him, so we asked a nurse who had some compassion for us and call the oncologist. He told us to come the next day and ask for an appointment during the day. We had to wait 3 hours the next day, with my mom in a wheelchair in pain and taking morphine every 2 hours. It was a reaction to some antibiotic. It took 2 weeks to go away.\nJuly 30, 13 miles Chapter 07: December 25th, After this, we got to just live one day at a time. Christmas came, we celebrate as we could. We had dinner at 7 pm and my mom was in bed at 8 pm as any other day. It was so sad seeing her eat that little. My mom enjoyed cooking and eating, but this year was not like that.\nAugust 12, 9 miles (back from vacation) Chapter 08: December 31st, Nothing else happened that last week of the year. New Year’s Eve came and we did the same as a normal day. I cooked some traditional empanadas and we were done by 8 pm. She barely could stay sitting for more than 20 minutes. She still needed help getting ready for bed. Amazingly, she could still go upstairs by herself though.\nAugust 19, 12 miles (back on training mode) Chapter 09: January 2023, last week of treatment. The first week of January she started to be able to change clothes by herself. That was nice to see. Gain some independence. We decided to walk for 10 minutes one day, and we repeated the next day. That helped her. It was time for me to come back to Boston. After all this month, at least my mom was moving a little bit more, and treatment seemed to be working. Protein M reduced by 50%.\nSeptember 2, 16 miles (hike in CT) Chapter 10: February 2023, the second cycle went without any surprise. Some skin reactions, but nothing compared to everything she went through in the past months. I tried to call every day, but it was difficult with work and time difference. Still, I could see she could move more. She kept walking 10min a day.\nSeptember 9, 18 miles Chapter 11: May to August 2023. She went through 4 more cycles, a total of 6 at this point. Numbers were going down every time. Although she improved, the pain is still there. Two weeks before I went to visit this past summer, she got a stomach virus that left her in bed again. No strength.

Although I am sure this event has a p-value \u0026gt; 0.05 , then is not significant. (wink wink)\nBut if you know me a little bit, you may be surprised about this change in my career. It was a difficult decision for me, indeed. Somehow, I see this as a no turning back point, maybe is not totally true. I have advocated, so many times, that my reason to stay in academia is that there are more chances to help each other, to create open-source resources, to move forward together… that somehow, moving to industry is the opposite of all that.\nHowever, academia couldn’t give me more, and I didn’t feel I was giving more. I decided a while ago to give up on a tenured career and dedicated many years to work inside a core facility at HSPH. I met awesome people, I learned from the best, I got to work with really amazing data…but there is a price for that. Being mainly an analyst made me see some parts that weren’t that nice. I realized many researchers will see you as a machine of producing data/figures/tables. They only care about that figure that will show the reviewer they were right. I saw how I couldn’t get into the project more than for a ‘quick’ analysis of the data, without getting into the biology or the goal of the project.\nNot only that, but I realized I hadn’t a future, I would be stuck forever in that position, it was a senior position, but I really want to move forward and up. And after my second try at MIT, in another Bioinformatics core, I didn’t see that coming any time soon.\nIt was time to think about why I am in the science business. Somehow, when I was young, I felt attracted to this world. I forgot about why, but what I liked was to work with people, together, to understand the molecular biology of a system. There was something else, it needed to be something that I believed in.\nAnd this is when eGenesis Bio - Engineering Life came into my sight. The vision is simple: stop people dying because of a lack of compatible organs. The solution is almost science fiction: genome editing on pigs to clone them and use those organs in humans.\nI went to meet them, and I found a wonderful team and a challenging project. It was time to decide, and it was hard. Curiously, the main reasons that were stopping for saying yes, were mainly related to fear. A fear that the system put on me:\nYou need to publish Nature, you need to be known on twitter, to be invited to conferences… otherwise, you won’t move forward in your career, you won’t have a good job. And yes, I don’t have first-author papers in Nature, I am not famous on twitter, I am not invited to conferences, and leaving academia means I will never be that, for sure. I felt like a failure. Because I didn’t get any of that, and I will never get it. And somehow, I ended up thinking that was the only way to measure success.\nLuckily me, I read this book I had since months ago: Brave, Not Perfect: Reshma Saujani, and helped me to see that feeling, those thoughts, as something external and not something that was part of me. At this point, I really wanted to forget about all the pressure I had on my shoulders and do just my job, my job on something that I consider relevant, and with the people I want to be.\nSo, of course, I decided to move on. If the only reason why you won’t make a change is because of fear to fail/change/future, then you should definitely do it. (read the book, seriously)\nIn summary, I got to meet myself again, after so many years doing what the system has told me to do to get a good job, and have a future. I remembered what is my passion, I remembered to believe in myself, and let life to reward my decisions differently (this I will know in a year or so).\nSome other things I did meanwhile I was in this phase:\nWrite my research, teaching and diversity statements and apply for Associate Professors to 5 different positions to 5 different universities. I didn’t pass any filter. Good mental exercise, yes, I know, 5 positions are nothing, you should apply to 30, or that was the main advice I got. I explored to change totally my career, as a project manager or data scientist in a non-biomedical field. I took some courses, and I didn’t feel the click that I expect when you are in the right place. I felt miserable and with the lowest self-esteem in my life. I started climbing indoors and working out with a personal trainer. All those negative feelings went away with time. Now I can do 2 pulls-up in a row for the first time in my life at the age of 37.

Single-cell cloning of modified cells is frequently used to facilitate studies of gene function. Inherent in this approach is an assumption that the genetic drift, amplified in some cell lines by mutations in DNA replication and repair machinery, as well as non-genetic factors will not introduce significant levels of experimental cellular heterogeneity in clones derived from parental populations. In this study, we characterize the variation in cell death of fifty clonal cell lines generated from human Jurkat and MOLT-4 T-cells edited by CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrate a wide distribution of sensitivity to chemotherapeutics between non-edited clonal human leukemia T-cell lines, and also following CRISPR-Cas9 editing at the NLRP1 locus, or following transfection with non-targeting sgRNA controls. The cell death sensitivity profile of clonal cell lines was consistent across experiments and failed to revert to the non-clonal parental phenotype. Whole genome sequencing of two clonal cell lines edited by CRISPR-Cas9 revealed unique and shared genetic variants, which had minimal read support in the non-clonal parental population and were not suspected CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects. These variants included genes related to cell death and drug metabolism. The variation in cell death phenotype of clonal populations of human T-cell lines may be a consequence of T-cell line genetic instability, and to a lesser extent clonal heterogeneity in the parental population or CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects not predicted by current models. This work highlights the importance of genetic variation between clonal T-cell lines in the design, conduct, and analysis of experiments to investigate gene function after single-cell cloning.

However, slurm is not a option to the documentation, BUT you can specify a template file:\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH -J __MRO_JOB_NAME__ #SBATCH -N 1 #SBATCH -c __MRO_THREADS__ #SBATCH --mem=__MRO_MEM_GB__G #SBATCH -o __MRO_STDOUT__ #SBATCH -e __MRO_STDERR__ #SBATCH -t 0-48:00:00 #SBATCH --qos=\u0026#34;normal\u0026#34; __MRO_CMD__ The command would look like this:\ncellranger count --id=SAMPLE --transcriptome=GRCh38_pre_mRNA \\ --fastqs=PATH2FASTQS --sample=SAMPLE \\ --jobmode=slurm.template \\ --maxjobs=3 --jobinterval=1000 I was feeling victory, ha ha ha, BUT I saw that the ALIGN step was requesting 220G of memory…. WHAT!!!!!????? or better WATTT????!!!!!.\nnote: this is set up during genome generation with the parameters:\n--memgb=\u0026lt;num\u0026gt; Maximum memory (GB) used when aligning reads with STAR. Defaults to 16. note: default is 16G but if I use that then my jobs are cancelled because using more memory than requested, as I expected considering STAR needs more than that for human genome.\nI guess I didn’t look at the first place I should have looked, but it took me some time to discovered that the memory is coming from a file in the reference genome folder:\ncat GRCh38_pre_mRNA/reference.json { \u0026#34;fasta_hash\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;954a9c3916ef1544c9358445440b9683fc061c71\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;genomes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;GRCh38_pre_mRNA\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;gtf_hash\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12aae438159b35282adaf643cca4dc5887b0448a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;input_fasta_files\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;input_gtf_files\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;GRC38_preRNA.gtf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;mem_gb\u0026#34;: 220, \u0026#34;mkref_version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3.0.2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;threads\u0026#34;: 24, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: null } I realized that when I found, after 100 ls/cat/less/grep, this file with these lines of code:\ncellranger-3.0.2/cellranger-cs/3.0.2/lib/python/cellranger/utils.py def _load_reference_metadata_file(reference_path): reference_metadata_file = os.path.join(reference_path, cr_constants.REFERENCE_METADATA_FILE) with open(reference_metadata_file, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as f: return json.load(f) So, easy peasy, I changed that to 110. I relaunched the job I was using to test, and found that it was still setting up 220G…WHY!?!!? well, it seems if you relaunch in a step where the alignment has already begun, there is a cache for the resources. So after more time trying to figure out this and asking myself, why I decided my career path to be bioinformatics, I tried a fresh start and…IT WORKED.\nHow happy one can be to see a job requesting the expected resources.\nIncredible happy!\nI went a step further, and looked how much memory actually it was using during the alignment step, and I saw that actually only needs 64G, so I updated to 72G, to gain more karma from the HPC world.\nThere is one more thing, that will set jobs of 72G and 4 cores, if you want to increase the number of cores, then use this option --mempercore 6 or whatever number that you want: mempercore = 72G/final_cores.\nWorkflow Finally, I felt that I was doing my best to behave and avoid making angry other people using the hpc. The final setup looks like this:\nmeta-script to send all the samples to a master job: runner.sh.

To determine whether the adrenal clock modulates GC responses to stress, experiments used female and male Cyp11A1Cre/+:: Bmal1Fl/Fl KO (SCC-KO) mice, in which the core clock gene, Bmal1, is deleted in all steroidogenic tissues including the adrenal cortex. Following restraint stress, female and male SCC-KO mice demonstrate augmented plasma corticosterone, but not plasma ACTH. In contrast, following submaximal scruff stress, plasma corticosterone was elevated only in female SCC-KO mice. Adrenal sensitivity to ACTH was measured in vitro using acutely dispersed adrenocortical cells. Maximal corticosterone responses to ACTH were elevated in cells from female KO mice without affecting the EC50 response. Neither the maximum nor the EC50 response to ACTH was affected in male cells, indicating that female SCC-KO show a stronger adrenal phenotype. Parallel experiments were done using female Cyp11B2 (Aldosterone Synthase)Cre/+:: Bmal1Fl/Fl mice, adrenal cortex-specific Bmal1 null (Ad-KO) mice. Plasma corticosterone was increased in Ad-KO mice following restraint or scruff stress, and in vitro responses to ACTH were elevated in adrenal cells from Ad-KO mice, replicating data from female SCC-KO mice. Gene analysis showed increased expression of adrenal genes in female SCC-KO mice involved in cell cycle control, cell adhesion-extracellular matrix interaction and ligand receptor activity that could promote steroid production. These observations underscore a role for adrenal Bmal1 as an attenuator of steroid secretion that is most prominent in female mice.

Here, we combined a high-throughput functional screening (HTFS) platform with a library of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to systematically identify sncRNAs that affect neuronal cell survival in basal conditions and in response to oxidative stress (OS), a major hallmark in neurodegenerative diseases. We considered hits commonly detected by two statistical methods in three biological replicates. Forty-seven ASOs targeting miRNAs (miRNA-ASOs) consistently decreased cell viability under basal conditions. A total of 60 miRNA-ASOs worsened cell viability impairment mediated by OS, with 36.6% commonly affecting cell viability under basal conditions. In addition, 40 miRNA-ASOs significantly protected neuronal cells from OS. In agreement with cell viability impairment, damaging miRNA-ASOs specifically induced increased free radical biogenesis. miRNAs targeted by the detrimental ASOs are enriched in the fraction of miRNAs downregulated by OS, suggesting that the miRNA expression pattern after OS contributes to neuronal damage. The present HTFS highlighted potentially druggable sncRNAs. However, future studies are needed to define the pathways by which the identified ASOs regulate cell survival and OS response and to explore the potential of translating the current findings into clinical applications.

Two commonly used mouse models were utilized: a reversible chemical-induced injury model (folic acid (FA) induced nephropathy) and an irreversible surgically-induced fibrosis model (unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)). mRNA and small RNA sequencing, as well as 10-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics were performed with kidney samples from different time points over the course of fibrosis development. The bioinformatics workflow used to process, technically validate, and combine the single omics data will be described.

Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies led to the discovery of isomiRs, which are miRNA sequence variants. While many miRNA-seq analysis tools exist, a lack of consensus on miRNA/isomiR analyses exists, and the resulting diversity of output formats hinders accurate comparisons between tools and precludes data sharing and the development of common downstream analysis methods. Findings: To overcome this situation, we present here a community-based project, miRTOP (miRNA Transcriptomic Open Project) working towards the optimization of miRNA analyses. The aim of miRTOP is to promote the development of downstream analysis tools that are compatible with any existing detection and quantification tool. Based on the existing GFF3 format, we first created a new standard format, mirGFF3, for the output of miRNA/isomiR detection and quantification results from small RNA-seq data. Additionally, we developed a command line Python tool, mirtop, to manage the mirGFF3 format. Currently, mirtop can convert into mirGFF3 the outputs of commonly used pipelines, such as seqbuster, miRge2.0, isomiR-SEA, sRNAbench, and Prost!, as well as BAM files. Its open architecture enables any tool or pipeline to output results in mirGFF3. Conclusions: Collectively a comprehensive isomiR categorization system, along with the accompanying mirGFF3 and mirtop API provide a complete solution for the standardization of miRNA and isomiR analysis, enabling data sharing, reporting, comparative analyses, and benchmarking, while promoting the development of common miRNA methods focusing on downstream steps to miRNA detection, annotation, and quantification.","tags":null,"title":"Unification of miRNA and isomiR research: the mirGFF3 format and the mirtop API","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This post will show how to configure quickly the colors for the annotation of rows/columns that go on top or on the side of a heatmap.\nI normally use pheatmap a lot.

They regulate targeted genes by RNA complementarity, generally between the miRNA seed region and the 3’ UTR of messenger RNAs. They have become relevant to the study of developmental stages and diseases. With the advance of sequencing technology, the cost of detecting the miRNA transcriptome has decreased substantially, and has led to the discovery of isomiRs (with slight sequence variations relative to the annotated miRNAs). As a consequence, the amount of miRNA data has increased exponentially in the last 5 years, together with the number of pipelines to analyze it. However, there is still a lack of consensus standards in storing and sharing such data, generating diverse output files; hindering comparison between tools, data sharing, and development of downstream analyses independent of the tools used for miRNA detection and quantification. Here, we present a community based, open source project to work toward the standardization of miRNA pipelines and encourage the development of downstream tools for visualization, differential expression, sample clustering, and model prediction analyses. This project is an international collaboration, with experts from different countries that have been developing miRNA pipelines and resources. We have described a standard format for the output of miRNA detection and quantification tools using small RNA-seq data. The format is based on the GFF3 standard in order to support reference coordinates and parent/child relationships between the features. The format contains information foreach sequence and its annotation to the miRNA precursor, the definition of reference or isomiR sequence, its quality, the isomiR type, and abundance in the data set. Moreover, we support a command line python tool to manage the miRNA GFF3 format (miRTop). Currently, miRTop can convert the output of commonly used small RNA-Seq pipelines, such as seqbuster, isomiR-SEA, sRNAbench, and Prost!, as well as BAM files to the miRNA GFF3 format. Importantly, the miRge pipeline has adapted the GFF3 format natively. miRTop can convert miRNA GFF3 files to a count matrix that can be easily imported to any downstream tool (i.e. for differential expression analysis). Furthermore, the tool can export the miRNA GFF file to the isomiRs package, improving the usability of this tool and rendering it independent of the upstream methods used for quantifying miRNA sequences. Together, we believe that the miRTop project will improve accessibility and uniformity of the results oft miRNA pipelines, the possibility to easily run benchmarking analyses, and promote the development of miRNA tools downstream of the detection and quantification steps.","tags":["miRNA","isomiR"],"title":"miRTOP: An open source community project for the development of a unified format file for miRNA data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mercedes Rubio","Mariona Bustamante","Carles Hernandez-Ferrer","Dietmar Fernandez-Orth","Lorena Pantano","Yaris Sarria","Maria Piqué-Borras","Kilian Vellve","Silvia Agramunt","Ramon Carreras","Xavier Estivill","Juan R.

This study aims to characterize and compare small RNA profiles in human biofluids. For this purpose, RNA was extracted from plasma and breast milk samples from 15 healthy postpartum mothers. Small RNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNexttextregistered small RNA library preparation kit and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. miRNAs, isomiRs and clusters of small RNAs were annotated using seqBuster/seqCluster framework in 5 plasma and 10 milk samples that passed the initial quality control. The RNA yield was 81 ng/mL [standard deviation (SD): 41] and 3985 ng/mL (SD: 3767) for plasma and breast milk, respectively. Mean number of good quality reads was 4.04 million (M) (40.01% of the reads) in plasma and 12.5M (89.6%) in breast milk. One thousand one hundred eighty two miRNAs, 12,084 isomiRs and 1,053 small RNA clusters that included piwi-interfering RNAs (piRNAs), tRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) were detected. Samples grouped by biofluid, with 308 miRNAs, 1,790 isomiRs and 778 small RNA clusters differentially detected. In summary, plasma and milk showed a different small RNA profile. In both, miRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs were identified, confirming the presence of non-miRNA species in plasma, and describing them for the first time in milk.","tags":null,"title":"Circulating miRNAs, isomiRs and small RNA clusters in human plasma and breast milk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael J.

People who know us, or collaborate with us, knows that we mainly use bcbio to analyze sequencing data (check it out, super cool tool).\nSomething that we are working on is to load the data after bcbio finishes into R to ease the downstream analysis. For instance, for RNA-seq we have bcbioRnaSeq and for small RNA-seq we have bcbioSmallRna. In short, these R packages make easy the task to load all the data generated by bcbio and wrap many methods and functions to generate the most used figures/analysis.\nThat is not the story. The story is that the bcbioRNADataSet object in those packages contains all the data in order to make easy the use of different counts matrix, or subset to a smaller samples/genes. For instance, the object contains the DDS object (DESeq2 DESeqDataSet), so we can use methods for this class or re-normalize at any point.\nWell, when we implemented the [ method (this allows to subset the object), we discovered that the object coming from that method was twice as big when saving into an RDA file. For instance, if you have an object with 34K genes, 100 samples that would be 900Mb when saving, then you subset to 1000 genes and 8 samples, you would end up with a file being 1.6G.\nThat is not nice, so I decided to play around. I don’t want you to read our code, because contains a lot of information, but feel free: subset. I value your time, so this is a dummy example.\nThe examples mainly creates different objects:\ndummyBig: 10K genes, 100 samples dummySmall: 500 genes, 5 samples dummySilly: subset of dummyBig using a silly function to subset, same size than dummySmall dummySmart: subset of dummyBig using a smart function to subset, same size than dummySmall We should expect that dummySilly and dummySmart have a similar size than dummySmall…\nThis is the size of RDA files for each of them (size in Kb):\nobject file rdaSize objSize dummyBig big.rda 2828.49 Kb 1588 Kb dummySmall micro.rda 24.19 Kb 42.6 Kb dummySilly microSilly.rda 4397.49 Kb 43.2 Kb dummySmart microSmart.rda 22.38 Kb 43.2 Kb rdaSize is the size of the file using save(obj, file = fileName.rda function. objSize is the size in memory in R using the function format(object.size(obj))\nAs you can see, microSilly is almost twice the original data, but microSmart is the expected size.\nI don’t know the exact reason, but the chunk of code that made the trick was to create an internal function to be called inside the method to re-generate the DESeq2 object with the smaller size.\nI know there should be a better way to avoid this, but this worked.

SP140 is one such bromodomain- and plant homeodomain (PHD)-containing reader with immune-restricted expression, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within SP140 associate with Crohn's disease (CD). However, the function of SP140 and the consequences of disease-associated SP140 SNPs have remained unclear. We show that SP140 is critical for transcriptional programs that uphold the macrophage state. SP140 preferentially occupies promoters of silenced, lineage-inappropriate genes bearing the histone modification H3K27me3, such as the HOXA cluster in human macrophages, and ensures their repression. Depletion of SP140 in mouse or human macrophages resulted in severely compromised microbe-induced activation. We reveal that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or B cells from individuals carrying CD-associated SNPs within SP140 have defective SP140 messenger RNA splicing and diminished SP140 protein levels. Moreover, CD patients carrying SP140 SNPs displayed suppressed innate immune gene signatures in a mixed population of PBMCs that stratified them from other CD patients. Hematopoietic-specific knockdown of Sp140 in mice resulted in exacerbated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and low SP140 levels in human CD intestinal biopsies correlated with relatively lower intestinal innate cytokine levels and improved response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Thus, the epigenetic reader SP140 is a key regulator of macrophage transcriptional programs for cellular state, and a loss of SP140 due to genetic variation contributes to a molecularly defined subset of CD characterized by ineffective innate immunity, normally critical for intestinal homeostasis.","tags":null,"title":"Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kenneth Daily","Shannan J.

The Infinium covered slightly more protein coding, cancer-associated and mitochondrial-related genes, both platforms covered all known imprinting clusters, and rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing covered more microRNA genes than the HumanMethylation450, but fewer than the MethylationEPIC. Rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing did not always interrogate exactly the same CpG loci, but genomic tiling improved overlap between different libraries. Reproducibility of rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and concordance between the platforms increased with CpG density.

Of the different types of small RNAs, the most important in mammals are miRNA, tRNA fragments and piRNAs. The advantage of small RNA-seq analysis is that we can study all small RNA types simultaneously, with the potential to detect novel small RNAs. bcbio-nextgen is a community- developed Python framework that implements best practices for next-generation sequence data analysis and uses gold standard data for validation. We have extended bcbio to include a small RNA-seq analysis pipeline that performs quality control, removal of adapter contamination, annotation of miRNA, isomiRs and tRNAs, novel miRNA discovery, and genome-wide characterization of other types of small RNAs. The pipeline integrates tools such as miRDeep2, seqbuster, seqcluster and tdrMapper to facilitate annotation to small RNA categories. It produces an R Markdown template that helps with downstream statistical analyses in R, including quality control metrics and best practices for differential expression and clustering analyses. Finally, the pipeline generates an interactive HTML-based browser for visualization purposes. This is useful for characterizing novel small RNA types, working with non-model organisms, or providing a general profiling description. This browser shows the small RNA regions along with their genomic annotation, expression profile over the precursor, secondary structure, and the top expressed sequences. Here, we show the capabilities of the pipeline and validation using data from the miRQC project. We show that the quantification accuracy is around 95% for miRNAs. We obtained similar results for other types of small RNA molecules, demonstrating that we can reliably detect small RNAs without a dependency on specific databases.","tags":[],"title":"Characterization of the small RNA transcriptome using the bcbio-nextgen python framework","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In summary: I will show which is the best miRNA mapping tool.

They were clearly developed for other purposes, but as well, they generate the input of many miRNA pipelines. I just wanted to know how well my tool was doing.

I have a repository for this kind of things, so anybody can reproduce my results, and check if I did something wrong, or comment on it. In this post I just want to know which tool detects more miRNA, for that I did two main steps:\nsimulate a bunch of miRNAs (isomirs) with my python script that is part of SeqBuster suit. I generated around 10000 sequences. Normally, one small-RNAseq library produces around half million different sequences. use only miRBase human precursors as reference genome I used default parameter for all, so probably there is a set of parameters that would be better for some tools, but I didn’t search for them this time (happy to accept issues to add them). The results are:\nmiraligner and STAR map more sequences. miraligner loses sequences shorter than 15 nt, normally (miRNA) are around 21, and those sequences map to repeat elements STAR is the best mapping, but need some parsing to reduce false positive. I think that pipelines should change to this tool. GEM has problems with additions and nt substitutions in many cases, same as novoaligner (I will look at this in the future) bowtie2/bowtie is the second that annotated most (and best) microrazer has a problem with mismatches, but maybe there is some parameter to trick miRExpress with default options only will map perfect matches sequences to precursor, so strongly recommended to allow errors to increase sensibility. I have to say that the advantage of miraligner is that it gives you the sequence annotated as miRNA or precursor, and gives you the exactly modifications that sequences have if they are compared to miRBase database. And you could feed the results to my R package to plot isomers distribution of samples from different groups, and do differential expression analysis with DESeq2, or another tool. I didn’t add time consumption because all of them run in a couple of minutes. In my next post I will focus in the the correct annotation of each sequence, and the possible problems with cross-mapping events, when the sequence comes from another regions of the genome but map to miRBase precursor as well [see my previous post for more details]. As well I will use STAR with the full genome and see if the mapping continues being the best.

Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations, upregulation of the TP63N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis. Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation, exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2).

We have used our tool to characterize and profile sRNAs in post-mortem brain samples of control individuals and Parkinson's disease (PD) cases at early-premotor and late-symptomatic stages. RESULTS: Clusters of co-expressed sRNAs mapping onto tRNAs significantly separated premotor and motor cases from controls. A similar result was obtained using a matrix of miRNAs slightly varying in sequence (isomiRs). The present framework revealed sRNA alterations at premotor stages of PD, which might reflect initial pathogenic perturbations. This tool may be useful to discover sRNA expression patterns linked to different biological conditions.

Yet, hundreds of RNA molecules remain in mature sperm. The biological significance of the vast majority of these molecules is unclear. To better understand the processes that generate sperm small RNAs and what roles they may have, we sequenced and characterized the small RNA content of sperm samples from two human fertile individuals. We detected 182 microRNAs, some of which are highly abundant. The most abundant microRNA in sperm is miR-1246 with predicted targets among sperm-specific genes. The most abundant class of small noncoding RNAs in sperm are PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Surprisingly, we found that human sperm cells contain piRNAs processed from pseudogenes. Clusters of piRNAs from human testes contain pseudogenes transcribed in the antisense strand and processed into small RNAs. Several human protein-coding genes contain antisense predicted targets of pseudogene-derived piRNAs in the male germline and these piRNAs are still found in mature sperm. Our study provides the most extensive data set and annotation of human sperm small RNAs to date and is a resource for further functional studies on the roles of sperm small RNAs. In addition, we propose that some of the pseudogene-derived human piRNAs may regulate expression of their parent gene in the male germline.","tags":["Humans","Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements","Male","MicroRNAs","MicroRNAs: genetics","Phylogeny","Promoter Regions","Genetic","Proteins","Proteins: metabolism","Pseudogenes","RNA","Small Interfering","RNA","Small Interfering: genetics","RNA","Small Interfering: metabolism","Sequence Analysis","RNA","Sequence Analysis","RNA: methods","Spermatozoa","Spermatozoa: metabolism","Testis","Testis: metabolism","selected"],"title":"The small RNA content of human sperm reveals pseudogene-derived piRNAs complementary to protein-coding genes.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Puig","David Castellano","Lorena Pantano","Carla Giner-Delgado","David Izquierdo","Magdalena Gayà-Vidal","José Ignacio Lucas-Lledó","Tõnu Esko","Chikashi Terao","Fumihiko Matsuda","Mario Cáceres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"4cae951b1a5664dd92393a5468950c86","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/puig-2015/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:14:44.089904Z","relpermalink":"/publication/puig-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite many years of study into inversions, very little is known about their functional consequences, especially in humans. A common hypothesis is that the selective value of inversions stems in part from their effects on nearby genes, although evidence of this in natural populations is almost nonexistent. Here we present a global analysis of a new 415-kb polymorphic inversion that is among the longest ones found in humans and is the first with clear position effects. This inversion is located in chromosome 19 and has been generated by non-homologous end joining between blocks of transposable elements with low identity. PCR genotyping in 541 individuals from eight different human populations allowed the detection of tag SNPs and inversion genotyping in multiple populations worldwide, showing that the inverted allele is mainly found in East Asia with an average frequency of 4.7%. Interestingly, one of the breakpoints disrupts the transcription factor gene ZNF257, causing a significant reduction in the total expression level of this gene in lymphoblastoid cell lines. RNA-Seq analysis of the effects of this expression change in standard homozygotes and inversion heterozygotes revealed distinct expression patterns that were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, we have found a new fusion transcript that is generated exclusively from inverted chromosomes around one of the breakpoints. Finally, by the analysis of the associated nucleotide variation, we have estimated that the inversion was generated ̃40,000-50,000 years ago and, while a neutral evolution cannot be ruled out, its current frequencies are more consistent with those expected for a deleterious variant, although no significant association with phenotypic traits has been found so far.","tags":null,"title":"Functional Impact and Evolution of a Novel Human Polymorphic Inversion That Disrupts a Gene and Creates a Fusion Transcript","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anita Öst","Adelheid Lempradl","Eduard Casas","Melanie Weigert","Theodor Tiko","Merdin Deniz","Lorena Pantano","Ulrike Boenisch","Pavel M.

Paternal sugar acts as a physiological suppressor of variegation, desilencing chromatin-state-defined domains in both mature sperm and in offspring embryos. We identify requirements for H3K9/K27me3-dependent reprogramming of metabolic genes in two distinct germline and zygotic windows.

Due to the complexity of this type of changes and the underlying high false-positive discovery rate, it is necessary to integrate all the available data to get a reliable estimate of the real number of inversions. InvFEST automatically merges predictions into different inversions, refines the breakpoint locations, and finds associations with genes and segmental duplications. In addition, it includes data on experimental validation, population frequency, functional effects and evolutionary history. All this information is readily accessible through a complete and user-friendly web report for each inversion. In its current version, InvFEST combines information from 34 different studies and contains 1092 candidate inversions, which are categorized based on internal scores and manual curation. Therefore, InvFEST aims to represent the most reliable set of human inversions and become a central repository to share information, guide future studies and contribute to the analysis of the functional and evolutionary impact of inversions on the human genome.","tags":null,"title":"InvFEST, a database integrating information of polymorphic inversions in the human genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hedda A Meijer","Ewan M Smith","Martin Bushell","A.

Thermodynamic features of the duplex appear to play an important role in this decision; the strand with the weakest binding at its 5'-end is more likely to become the guide strand. Other key characteristics of human miRNA guide strands are a U-bias at the 5'-end and an excess of purines, whereas the passenger strands have a C-bias at the 5'-end and an excess of pyrimidines. Several proteins are known to play a role in strand selection [Ago (Argonaute), DICER, TRBP (trans-activation response RNA-binding protein), PACT (protein activator of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase) and Xrn-1/2]; however, the mechanisms by which these proteins act are largely unknown. For several miRNAs the miR/miR* ratio varies dependent on cell type, developmental stage and in different disease states, suggesting that strand selection is a tightly controlled process.

Everybody is using it to annotate small RNA sequences as miRNA or not. And it is great, and very helpfully…but there are some cases that we should investigate our results.\nFor instance, what happens with miR-1246? it is a recent miRNA, primate specific, detected by sequencing in different studies (1,2,3). The counts related to these sequences are not so high, actually very low after normalization, but still are there. miRBase gives a precursor this region: chr2: 177465708-177465780 [-]\nFig 1: mir1246 We see that there is a repeat element (ERV, retrovirus) and also it is a pretty conserved region. Until here, everything allright. But, I realized some time ago, annotating some data that I had, that the mature miRNA annotates in other regions:\nchr:start-end strand type conservation chr13:21,186,304-21,186,473 + U2 human chr14:96,850,961-96,851,148 + U2 rhesus chr5:157,403,780-157,403,964 - U2 rhesus chr6:89,773,226-89,773,409 - U2 rhesus chr13:46,948,540-46,948,725 - U2 rhesus chr3:127,793,920-127,794,092 - U2 rhesus chr2:177,465,708-177,465,780 - miR-1246 rhesus,mouse,dog,elephant All of them are copies of a RNA repeat according RepBase, specifically the snRNA U2 class (150-200 nt). In addition, I got much more reads inside those (extra) locations than inside the annotated precursor (3 orders bigger). Furthermore, all of them had a peak in their coverage profile (fig 2).\nFig 2:Reads coverage of U2 The question that arises now: is this a real miRNA, or a sub-product, or both? with any function? Maybe there is more than one precursor, or maybe it is a miRNA-like snRNA. Moreover, the secondary structure of these U2 is very similar to a miRNA precursor hairpin (fig 3).\nFig 3:U2 secondary structure One cause of this annotation could be that the unique precursor conserved beyond primates is the one mentioned in miRBase, while the other U2 locations are primate-specific. Extra analyses should be done to reveal the real nature of this miRNA. Results suggest that, either the miRNA has more than one precursor, or a sub-product, or both.\nAs an extra-analysis, I took public data, KO Dicer and control, of HELA cells (GSM769512) to study the dependency od these sequences to DICER. You expect a decrease in the number of counts of miRNA sequences, between control and KO dicer. The exact miRNA sequence decrease 1/3 in KO dicer cells, assuming a Dicer dependency, and take this sequence as a real miRNA. But, we have a lot of other sequences in the U2 regions, but not in the annotated precursor, and only differ in one extra nucleotide (Adenosine) at the beginning (miR-1246: AAUGGAUUUUUGGAGCAGG and U2: AAAUGGAUUUUUGGAGCAGG).This sequence can be annotated as miR-1246 if you allow 1 mismatch in the alignment (the A nt). This sequence had the same counts in normal cells and KO cells, suggesting that sequences from U2 are not Dicer-dependent. Summarizing, we have the mature annotated miRNA mapping in all these positions, and in addition, we have other sequences (one nt longer), that only map in the U2 positions. So, how we can differentiate what proportion of sequences comes from the precursors and what comes from the other positions? Well, one possibility is to detect the precursor by PCR in your samples, to assume that at least it is there, or try to see whether the coverage in the different locations makes sense more with one scenario or another…Or maybe it is not a big deal, you have this small RNA, the question is whether it has any regulatory function or not.\nFrom here, we may agree that it is better to double-check what is happening when annotating small RNAs, because there are many possibilities to take a wrong conclusion if you only believe in a preliminary analysis. Nowadays, data is increasing a lot, and scientists need to make a bunch of assumptions to obtain something, but be careful with those assumptions (indeed, they are needed to evolve in science) because you may be missing something else or getting something wrong or wasting your time with experiments to corroborate your computational results.\nReferences\n[1] PMID:18583537\n“MicroRNA discovery and profiling in human embryonic stem cells by deep sequencing of small RNA libraries”\nBar M, Wyman SK, Fritz BR, Qi J, Garg KS, Parkin RK, Kroh EM, Bendoraite A, Mitchell PS, Nelson AM, Ruzzo WL, Ware C, Radich JP, Gentleman R, Ruohola-Baker H, Tewari M\nStem Cells. 26:2496-2505(2008).\n[2] PMID:20300190\n“Characterization of the Melanoma miRNAome by Deep Sequencing”\nStark MS, Tyagi S, Nancarrow DJ, Boyle GM, Cook AL, Whiteman DC, Parsons PG, Schmidt C, Sturm RA, Hayward NK\nPLoS One. 5:e9685(2010).\n[3] PMID:20459774\n“Ultra-high throughput sequencing-based small RNA discovery and discrete statistical biomarker analysis in a collection of cervical tumours and matched controls”\nWitten D, Tibshirani R, Gu SG, Fire A, Lui WO\nBMC Biol. 8:58(2010).\n","date":1369663982,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369663982,"objectID":"b2a9c80c51f7796a868c0445fa40d3e5","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/post/legacy/2013-05-27-mirna-annotation-complex-scenarios/","publishdate":"2013-05-27T10:13:02-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/legacy/2013-05-27-mirna-annotation-complex-scenarios/","section":"post","summary":"Everybody who is working with microRNA knows about miRBase, it was the first miRNA catalogue.

High-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed heterogeneity at length and sequence level for the majority of mature miRNAs (IsomiRs). Most isomiRs can be explained by variability in either Dicer1 or Drosha cleavage during miRNA biogenesis at 5' or 3' of the miRNA (trimming variants). Although isomiRs have been described in different tissues and organisms, their functional validation as modulators of gene expression remains elusive. Here we have characterized the expression and function of a highly abundant miR-101 5'-trimming variant (5'-isomiR-101).  RESULTS: The analysis of small RNA sequencing data in several human tissues and cell lines indicates that 5'-isomiR-101 is ubiquitously detected and a highly abundant, especially in the brain. 5'-isomiR-101 was found in Ago-2 immunocomplexes and complementary approaches showed that 5'-isomiR-101 interacted with different members of the silencing (RISC) complex. In addition, 5'-isomiR-101 decreased the expression of five validated miR-101 targets, suggesting that it is a functional variant. Both the binding to RISC members and the degree of silencing were less efficient for 5'-isomiR-101 compared with miR-101. For some targets, both miR-101 and 5'-isomiR-101 significantly decreased protein expression with no changes in the respective mRNA levels. Although a high number of overlapping predicted targets suggest similar targeted biological pathways, a correlation analysis of the expression profiles of miR-101 variants and predicted mRNA targets in human brains at different ages, suggest specific functions for miR-101- and 5'-isomiR-101.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that isomiRs are functional variants and further indicate that for a given miRNA, the different isomiRs may contribute to the overall effect as quantitative and qualitative fine-tuners of gene expression.","tags":["Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor: deficiency","Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor: genetics","Argonaute Proteins","Argonaute Proteins: metabolism","Cell Line","Cyclooxygenase 2","Cyclooxygenase 2: deficiency","Cyclooxygenase 2: genetics","DEAD-box RNA Helicases","DEAD-box RNA Helicases: metabolism","Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1","Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1: deficiency","Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1: genetics","Gene Expression Regulation","Gene Expression Regulation: genetics","Gene Silencing","Humans","MicroRNAs","MicroRNAs: genetics","MicroRNAs: metabolism","Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein","Polycomb Repressive Complex 2","Polycomb Repressive Complex 2: deficiency","Polycomb Repressive Complex 2: genetics","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2: deficiency","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2: genetics","Proto-Oncogene Proteins: metabolism","RNA Isoforms","RNA Isoforms: genetics","RNA Isoforms: metabolism"],"title":"A highly expressed miR-101 isomiR is a functional silencing small RNA.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franc Llorens","Manuela Hummel","Lorena Pantano","Xavier Pastor","Ana Vivancos","Ester Castillo","Heidi Mattlin","Anna Ferrer","Matthew Ingham","Marc Noguera","Robert Kofler","Juliane C Dohm","Raquel Pluvinet","Mònica Bayés","Heinz Himmelbauer","José Antonio del Rio","Eulàlia Martí","Lauro Sumoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"949dcaf4bcf521514d358ab084c1f1c5","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/llorens-2013-a/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:14:44.100255Z","relpermalink":"/publication/llorens-2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) plays an important function in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its receptor (EGFR) and providing cancer cells with increased survival responsiveness. Signal transduction carried out by EGF has been extensively studied at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Little is known about the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the EGF signaling pathway. miRNAs have emerged as major players in the complex networks of gene regulation, and cancer miRNA expression studies have evidenced a direct involvement of miRNAs in cancer progression.  RESULTS: In this study, we have used an integrative high content analysis approach to identify the specific miRNAs implicated in EGF signaling in HeLa cells as potential mediators of cancer mediated functions. We have used microarray and deep-sequencing technologies in order to obtain a global view of the EGF miRNA transcriptome with a robust experimental cross-validation. By applying a procedure based on Rankprod tests, we have delimited a solid set of EGF-regulated miRNAs. After validating regulated miRNAs by reverse transcription quantitative PCR, we have derived protein networks and biological functions from the predicted targets of the regulated miRNAs to gain insight into the potential role of miRNAs in EGF-treated cells. In addition, we have analyzed sequence heterogeneity due to editing relative to the reference sequence (isomiRs) among regulated miRNAs.  CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the use of global genomic miRNA cross-validation derived from high throughput technologies can be used to generate more reliable datasets inferring more robust networks of co-regulated predicted miRNA target genes.","tags":["Epidermal Growth Factor","Epidermal Growth Factor: pharmacology","Gene Silencing","Gene Targeting","Genomics","Genomics: methods","HeLa Cells","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing: methods","Humans","MicroRNAs","MicroRNAs: genetics","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis: methods","Sequence Analysis","RNA","Signal Transduction","Signal Transduction: drug effects","Signal Transduction: genetics","Transcription","Genetic","Transcription","Genetic: drug effects","Transcription","Genetic: genetics"],"title":"Microarray and deep sequencing cross-platform analysis of the mirRNome and isomiR variation in response to epidermal growth factor.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I spent all my PhD working with small RNA sequences data.

The abnormally extended polyglutamine in the HTT protein encoded by the CAG repeats has toxic effects. Here, we provide evidence to support that the mutant HTT CAG repeats interfere with cell viability at the RNA level. In human neuronal cells, expanded HTT exon-1 mRNA with CAG repeat lengths above the threshold for complete penetrance (40 or greater) induced cell death and increased levels of small CAG-repeated RNAs (sCAGs), of ≈21 nucleotides in a Dicer-dependent manner. The severity of the toxic effect of HTT mRNA and sCAG generation correlated with CAG expansion length. Small RNAs obtained from cells expressing mutant HTT and from HD human brains significantly decreased neuronal viability, in an Ago2-dependent mechanism. In both cases, the use of anti-miRs specific for sCAGs efficiently blocked the toxic effect, supporting a key role of sCAGs in HTT-mediated toxicity. Luciferase-reporter assays showed that expanded HTT silences the expression of CTG-containing genes that are down-regulated in HD. These results suggest a possible link between HD and sCAG expression with an aberrant activation of the siRNA/miRNA gene silencing machinery, which may trigger a detrimental response. The identification of the specific cellular processes affected by sCAGs may provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying HD, offering opportunities to develop new therapeutic approaches.","tags":["Biology","Gene expression","Genetics and Genomics","Genomics","Molecular Biology","Molecular cell biology","Nucleic acids","RNA","Research Article"],"title":"A Pathogenic Mechanism in Huntington's Disease Involves Small CAG-Repeated RNAs with Neurotoxic Activity.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena Pantano","Xavier Estivill","Eulalia Martí"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1320105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1320105600,"objectID":"d30cf76bfa94a1f5e3c61f639b7e07bf","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/pantano-2011/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:15:28.610452Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pantano-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"MOTIVATION: Recent progress in high-throughput sequencing technologies has largely contributed to reveal a highly complex landscape of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), including novel non-canonical sRNAs derived from long non-coding RNA, repeated elements, transcription start sites and splicing site regions among others.

More than 80% of the small-RNAs were annotated as microRNAs (miRNAs) in all samples. Deep sequencing revealed length and sequence heterogeneity (IsomiRs) for the vast majority of miRNAs.

This type of human variation can make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) is a targeted method to assess copy number differences for up to 40 genomic loci in one single experiment. Although specific MLPA assays can be ordered from MRC-Holland (the proprietary company of the MLPA technology), custom designs are also developed in many laboratories worldwide. After our own experience, an important drawback of custom MLPA assays is the time spent during the design of the specific oligonucleotides that are used as probes. Due to the large number of probes included in a single assay, a number of restrictions need to be met in order to maximize specificity and to increase success likelihood. Results: We have developed a web tool for facilitating and optimising custom probe design for MLPA experiments. The algorithm only requires the target sequence in FASTA format and a set of parameters, that are provided by the user according to each specific MLPA assay, to identify the best probes inside the given region. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first available tool for optimizing custom probe design of MLPA assays. The ease-of-use and speed of the algorithm dramatically reduces the turn around time of probe design. ProSeeK will become a useful tool for all laboratories that are currently using MLPA in their research projects for CNV studies.","tags":["*Internet","*User-Computer Interface","Algorithms","DNA Probes/*chemical synthesis","Humans","Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods","algorithms","dna probes","dna probes chemical synthesis","humans","internet","nucleic acid amplification techniques","nucleic acid amplification techniques methods","user computer interface"],"title":"ProSeeK: A web server for MLPA probe design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Priscila Grynberg","Thomas Abeel","Pedro Lopes","Geoff Macintyre","Lorena Pantano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"0d99c806f0c315f033ee142043aa5f36","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/grynberg-2007/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:14:44.104084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grynberg-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract In this meeting report we give an overview of the 3rd International Society for Computational Biology Student Council Symposium.

Alignment of DNA sequence from different sources has been used to identify SNPs and intermediate-sized variants (ISVs). However, only a small proportion of total heterogeneity is characterized, and little is known of the characteristics of most smaller-sized (1.5 million SNPs. Some differences were simple insertions and deletions, but in regions containing CNVs, segmental duplication and repetitive DNA, they were more complex. Our results uncover substantial undescribed variation in humans, highlighting the need for comprehensive annotation strategies to fully interpret genome scanning and personalized sequencing projects.","tags":["*Genetic Variation","*Genome","Base Sequence","DNA/genetics","Fluorescence","Genomics","Human","Humans","In Situ Hybridization","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Sequence Alignment","base sequence","dna","dna genetics","fluorescence","genetic variation","genome","genomics","human","humans","polymerase chain reaction","sequence alignment","situ hybridization"],"title":"Genome assembly comparison identifies structural variants in the human genome.","type":"publication"}]
