Although I am sure this event has a p-value \u0026gt; 0.05 , then ~is not significant.~ (wink wink)\nBut if you know me a little bit, you may be surprised about this change in my career. It was a difficult decision for me, indeed. Somehow, I see this as a no turning back point, maybe is not totally true. I have advocated, so many times, that my reason to stay in academia is that there are more chances to help each other, to create open-source resources, to move forward together… that somehow, moving to industry is the opposite of all that.\nHowever, academia couldn’t give me more, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel I was giving more. I decided a while ago to give up on a tenured career and dedicated many years to work inside a core facility at HSPH. I met awesome people, I learned from the best, I got to work with really amazing data…but there is a price for that. Being mainly an analyst made me see some parts that weren’t that nice. I realized many researchers will see you as a machine of producing data/figures/tables. They only care about that figure that will show the reviewer they were right. I saw how I couldn’t get into the project more than for a \u0026lsquo;quick\u0026rsquo; analysis of the data, without getting into the biology or the goal of the project.\nNot only that, but I realized I hadn’t a future, I would be stuck forever in that position, it was a senior position, but I really want to move forward and up. And after my second try at MIT, in another Bioinformatics core, I didn’t see that coming any time soon.\nIt was time to think about why I am in the science business. Somehow, when I was young, I felt attracted to this world. I forgot about why, but what I liked was to work with people, together, to understand the molecular biology of a system. There was something else, it needed to be something that I believed in.\nAnd this is when eGenesis Bio - Engineering Life came into my sight. The vision is simple: stop people dying because of a lack of compatible organs. The solution is almost science fiction: genome editing on pigs to clone them and use those organs in humans.\nI went to meet them, and I found a wonderful team and a challenging project. It was time to decide, and it was hard. Curiously, the main reasons that were stopping for saying yes, were mainly related to fear. A fear that the system put on me:\n You need to publish Nature, you need to be known on twitter, to be invited to conferences… otherwise, you won’t move forward in your career, you won’t have a good job.  And yes, I don’t have first-author papers in Nature, I am not ~famous on twitter,~ I am not invited to conferences, and leaving academia means I will never be that, for sure. I felt like a failure. Because I didn’t get any of that, and I will never get it. And somehow, I ended up thinking that was the only way to measure success.\nLuckily me, I read this book I had since months ago: Brave, Not Perfect: Reshma Saujani, and helped me to see that feeling, those thoughts, as something external and not something that was part of me. At this point, I really wanted to forget about all the pressure I had on my shoulders and do just my job, my job on something that I consider relevant, and with the people I want to be.\nSo, of course, I decided to move on. If the only reason why you won’t make a change is because of fear to fail/change/future, then you should definitely do it. (read the book, seriously)\nIn summary, I got to meet myself again, after so many years doing what the system has told me to do to get a good job, and have a future. I remembered what is my passion, I remembered to believe in myself, and let life to reward my decisions differently (this I will know in a year or so).\nSome other things I did meanwhile I was in this crisis:\n Write my research, teaching and diversity statements and apply for Associate Professors to 5 different positions to 5 different universities. I didn’t pass any filter.  Good mental exercise, yes, I know, 5 positions are nothing, you should apply to 30, or that was the main advice I got.   I explored to change totally my career, as a project manager or data scientist in a non-biomedical field.  I took some courses, and I didn’t feel the click that I expect when you are in the right place.   I felt miserable and with the lowest self-esteem in my life.  I started climbing indoors and working out with a personal trainer. All those negative feelings went away with time. Now I can do 2 pulls-up is a row for the first time in my life at the age of 37.

Single-cell cloning of modified cells is frequently used to facilitate studies of gene function. Inherent in this approach is an assumption that the genetic drift, amplified in some cell lines by mutations in DNA replication and repair machinery, as well as non-genetic factors will not introduce significant levels of experimental cellular heterogeneity in clones derived from parental populations. In this study, we characterize the variation in cell death of fifty clonal cell lines generated from human Jurkat and MOLT-4 T-cells edited by CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrate a wide distribution of sensitivity to chemotherapeutics between non-edited clonal human leukemia T-cell lines, and also following CRISPR-Cas9 editing at the NLRP1 locus, or following transfection with non-targeting sgRNA controls. The cell death sensitivity profile of clonal cell lines was consistent across experiments and failed to revert to the non-clonal parental phenotype. Whole genome sequencing of two clonal cell lines edited by CRISPR-Cas9 revealed unique and shared genetic variants, which had minimal read support in the non-clonal parental population and were not suspected CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects. These variants included genes related to cell death and drug metabolism. The variation in cell death phenotype of clonal populations of human T-cell lines may be a consequence of T-cell line genetic instability, and to a lesser extent clonal heterogeneity in the parental population or CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects not predicted by current models. This work highlights the importance of genetic variation between clonal T-cell lines in the design, conduct, and analysis of experiments to investigate gene function after single-cell cloning.

Meanwhile it helps a lot to run from bcl files to single cell counts matrixes, I discovered that is quite difficult to control many options related to optimization.\nI have to run more than 200 samples in a short time of period. In my current position at MIT, I joined the OpenMind cluster in the McGovern institute. I was pleased to find a very flexible cluster, but as any other cluster you need to respect other users.\nMy samples are human samples, so I need a lot of memory so STAR can run. The command line is easy to set up:\ncellranger count --id=SAMPLE --transcriptome=GRCh38_pre_mRNA --fastqs=PATH2FASTQS --sample=SAMPLE\nOf course, that is in local mode. If you want to set up a job to a cluster, it would look like this:\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH -N 1 #SBATCH -c 6 #SBATCH --mem=12000 #SBATCH -t 0-48:00:00 #SBATCH -J cellr #SBATCH -e job-counts.e #SBATCH -o job-counts.o ## SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL # this line is commented ## SBATCH --mail-user=user@mit.edu # this line is commented cellranger count --id=SAMPLE --transcriptome=GRCh38_pre_mRNA \\ --fastqs=PATH2FASTQS --sample=SAMPLE \\ --localcores=6 --localmem=120  The main problem with that is you are using 120G during all the process that could go to 1-2 days.\nI discovered that you can setup the  cluster mode to make cellranger to send jobs to the cluster. However, slurm is not a option to the documentation, BUT you can specify a template file:\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH -J __MRO_JOB_NAME__ #SBATCH -N 1 #SBATCH -c __MRO_THREADS__ #SBATCH --mem=__MRO_MEM_GB__G #SBATCH -o __MRO_STDOUT__ #SBATCH -e __MRO_STDERR__ #SBATCH -t 0-48:00:00 #SBATCH --qos=\u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; __MRO_CMD__  The command would look like this:\ncellranger count --id=SAMPLE --transcriptome=GRCh38_pre_mRNA \\ --fastqs=PATH2FASTQS --sample=SAMPLE \\ --jobmode=slurm.template \\ --maxjobs=3 --jobinterval=1000  I was feeling victory, ha ha ha, BUT I saw that the ALIGN step was requesting 220G of memory\u0026hellip;. WHAT!!!!!????? or better WATTT????!!!!!.\nnote: this is set up during genome generation with the parameters:\n --memgb=\u0026lt;num\u0026gt; Maximum memory (GB) used when aligning reads with STAR. Defaults to 16.  note: default is 16G but if I use that then my jobs are cancelled because using more memory than requested, as I expected considering STAR needs more than that for human genome.\nI guess I didn\u0026rsquo;t look at the first place I should have looked, but it took me some time to discovered that the memory is coming from a file in the reference genome folder:\ncat GRCh38_pre_mRNA/reference.json { \u0026quot;fasta_hash\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;954a9c3916ef1544c9358445440b9683fc061c71\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;genomes\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;GRCh38_pre_mRNA\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;gtf_hash\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;12aae438159b35282adaf643cca4dc5887b0448a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;input_fasta_files\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;input_gtf_files\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;GRC38_preRNA.gtf\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;mem_gb\u0026quot;: 220, \u0026quot;mkref_version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;3.0.2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;threads\u0026quot;: 24, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: null }  I realized that when I found, after 100 ls/cat/less/grep, this file with these lines of code:\ncellranger-3.0.2/cellranger-cs/3.0.2/lib/python/cellranger/utils.py def _load_reference_metadata_file(reference_path): reference_metadata_file = os.path.join(reference_path, cr_constants.REFERENCE_METADATA_FILE) with open(reference_metadata_file, 'r') as f: return json.load(f)  So, easy peasy, I changed that to 110. I relaunched the job I was using to test, and found that it was still setting up 220G\u0026hellip;WHY!?!!? well, it seems if you relaunch in a step where the alignment has already begun, there is a cache for the resources. So after more time trying to figure out this and asking myself, why I decided my career path to be bioinformatics, I tried a fresh start and\u0026hellip;IT WORKED.\n How happy one can be to see a job requesting the expected resources.\n  Incredible happy!\n I went a step further, and looked how much memory actually it was using during the alignment step, and I saw that actually only needs 64G, so I updated to 72G, to gain more karma from the HPC world.\nThere is one more thing, that will set jobs of 72G and 4 cores, if you want to increase the number of cores, then use this option --mempercore 6 or whatever number that you want: mempercore = 72G/final_cores.\nWorkflow Finally, I felt that I was doing my best to behave and avoid making angry other people using the hpc.

To determine whether the adrenal clock modulates GC responses to stress, experiments used female and male Cyp11A1Cre/+:: Bmal1Fl/Fl KO (SCC-KO) mice, in which the core clock gene, Bmal1, is deleted in all steroidogenic tissues including the adrenal cortex. Following restraint stress, female and male SCC-KO mice demonstrate augmented plasma corticosterone, but not plasma ACTH. In contrast, following submaximal scruff stress, plasma corticosterone was elevated only in female SCC-KO mice. Adrenal sensitivity to ACTH was measured in vitro using acutely dispersed adrenocortical cells. Maximal corticosterone responses to ACTH were elevated in cells from female KO mice without affecting the EC50 response. Neither the maximum nor the EC50 response to ACTH was affected in male cells, indicating that female SCC-KO show a stronger adrenal phenotype. Parallel experiments were done using female Cyp11B2 (Aldosterone Synthase)Cre/+:: Bmal1Fl/Fl mice, adrenal cortex-specific Bmal1 null (Ad-KO) mice. Plasma corticosterone was increased in Ad-KO mice following restraint or scruff stress, and in vitro responses to ACTH were elevated in adrenal cells from Ad-KO mice, replicating data from female SCC-KO mice. Gene analysis showed increased expression of adrenal genes in female SCC-KO mice involved in cell cycle control, cell adhesion-extracellular matrix interaction and ligand receptor activity that could promote steroid production. These observations underscore a role for adrenal Bmal1 as an attenuator of steroid secretion that is most prominent in female mice.

Here, we combined a high-throughput functional screening (HTFS) platform with a library of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to systematically identify sncRNAs that affect neuronal cell survival in basal conditions and in response to oxidative stress (OS), a major hallmark in neurodegenerative diseases. We considered hits commonly detected by two statistical methods in three biological replicates. Forty-seven ASOs targeting miRNAs (miRNA-ASOs) consistently decreased cell viability under basal conditions. A total of 60 miRNA-ASOs worsened cell viability impairment mediated by OS, with 36.6% commonly affecting cell viability under basal conditions. In addition, 40 miRNA-ASOs significantly protected neuronal cells from OS. In agreement with cell viability impairment, damaging miRNA-ASOs specifically induced increased free radical biogenesis. miRNAs targeted by the detrimental ASOs are enriched in the fraction of miRNAs downregulated by OS, suggesting that the miRNA expression pattern after OS contributes to neuronal damage. The present HTFS highlighted potentially druggable sncRNAs. However, future studies are needed to define the pathways by which the identified ASOs regulate cell survival and OS response and to explore the potential of translating the current findings into clinical applications.

Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies led to the discovery of isomiRs, which are miRNA sequence variants. While many miRNA-seq analysis tools exist, a lack of consensus on miRNA/isomiR analyses exists, and the resulting diversity of output formats hinders accurate comparisons between tools and precludes data sharing and the development of common downstream analysis methods. Findings: To overcome this situation, we present here a community-based project, miRTOP (miRNA Transcriptomic Open Project) working towards the optimization of miRNA analyses. The aim of miRTOP is to promote the development of downstream analysis tools that are compatible with any existing detection and quantification tool. Based on the existing GFF3 format, we first created a new standard format, mirGFF3, for the output of miRNA/isomiR detection and quantification results from small RNA-seq data. Additionally, we developed a command line Python tool, mirtop, to manage the mirGFF3 format. Currently, mirtop can convert into mirGFF3 the outputs of commonly used pipelines, such as seqbuster, miRge2.0, isomiR-SEA, sRNAbench, and Prost!, as well as BAM files. Its open architecture enables any tool or pipeline to output results in mirGFF3. Conclusions: Collectively a comprehensive isomiR categorization system, along with the accompanying mirGFF3 and mirtop API provide a complete solution for the standardization of miRNA and isomiR analysis, enabling data sharing, reporting, comparative analyses, and benchmarking, while promoting the development of common miRNA methods focusing on downstream steps to miRNA detection, annotation, and quantification.","tags":null,"title":"Unification of miRNA and isomiR research: the mirGFF3 format and the mirtop API","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This post will show how to configure quickly the colors for the annotation of rows/columns that go on top or on the side of a heatmap.\nI normally use pheatmap a lot.

They regulate targeted genes by RNA complementarity, generally between the miRNA seed region and the 3’ UTR of messenger RNAs. They have become relevant to the study of developmental stages and diseases. With the advance of sequencing technology, the cost of detecting the miRNA transcriptome has decreased substantially, and has led to the discovery of isomiRs (with slight sequence variations relative to the annotated miRNAs). As a consequence, the amount of miRNA data has increased exponentially in the last 5 years, together with the number of pipelines to analyze it. However, there is still a lack of consensus standards in storing and sharing such data, generating diverse output files; hindering comparison between tools, data sharing, and development of downstream analyses independent of the tools used for miRNA detection and quantification. Here, we present a community based, open source project to work toward the standardization of miRNA pipelines and encourage the development of downstream tools for visualization, differential expression, sample clustering, and model prediction analyses. This project is an international collaboration, with experts from different countries that have been developing miRNA pipelines and resources. We have described a standard format for the output of miRNA detection and quantification tools using small RNA-seq data. The format is based on the GFF3 standard in order to support reference coordinates and parent/child relationships between the features. The format contains information foreach sequence and its annotation to the miRNA precursor, the definition of reference or isomiR sequence, its quality, the isomiR type, and abundance in the data set. Moreover, we support a command line python tool to manage the miRNA GFF3 format (miRTop). Currently, miRTop can convert the output of commonly used small RNA-Seq pipelines, such as seqbuster, isomiR-SEA, sRNAbench, and Prost!, as well as BAM files to the miRNA GFF3 format. Importantly, the miRge pipeline has adapted the GFF3 format natively. miRTop can convert miRNA GFF3 files to a count matrix that can be easily imported to any downstream tool (i.e. for differential expression analysis). Furthermore, the tool can export the miRNA GFF file to the isomiRs package, improving the usability of this tool and rendering it independent of the upstream methods used for quantifying miRNA sequences. Together, we believe that the miRTop project will improve accessibility and uniformity of the results oft miRNA pipelines, the possibility to easily run benchmarking analyses, and promote the development of miRNA tools downstream of the detection and quantification steps.","tags":["miRNA","isomiR"],"title":"miRTOP: An open source community project for the development of a unified format file for miRNA data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mercedes Rubio","Mariona Bustamante","Carles Hernandez-Ferrer","Dietmar Fernandez-Orth","Lorena Pantano","Yaris Sarria","Maria Piqué-Borras","Kilian Vellve","Silvia Agramunt","Ramon Carreras","Xavier Estivill","Juan R.

Small RNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNexttextregistered small RNA library preparation kit and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. miRNAs, isomiRs and clusters of small RNAs were annotated using seqBuster/seqCluster framework in 5 plasma and 10 milk samples that passed the initial quality control. The RNA yield was 81 ng/mL [standard deviation (SD): 41] and 3985 ng/mL (SD: 3767) for plasma and breast milk, respectively. Mean number of good quality reads was 4.04 million (M) (40.01% of the reads) in plasma and 12.5M (89.6%) in breast milk. One thousand one hundred eighty two miRNAs, 12,084 isomiRs and 1,053 small RNA clusters that included piwi-interfering RNAs (piRNAs), tRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) were detected.

People who know us, or collaborate with us, knows that we mainly use bcbio to analyze sequencing data (check it out, super cool tool).\nSomething that we are working on is to load the data after bcbio finishes into R to ease the downstream analysis. For instance, for RNA-seq we have bcbioRnaSeq and for small RNA-seq we have bcbioSmallRna. In short, these R packages make easy the task to load all the data generated by bcbio and wrap many methods and functions to generate the most used figures/analysis.\nThat is not the story. The story is that the bcbioRNADataSet object in those packages contains all the data in order to make easy the use of different counts matrix, or subset to a smaller samples/genes. For instance, the object contains the DDS object (DESeq2 DESeqDataSet), so we can use methods for this class or re-normalize at any point.\nWell, when we implemented the [ method (this allows to subset the object), we discovered that the object coming from that method was twice as big when saving into an RDA file. For instance, if you have an object with 34K genes, 100 samples that would be 900Mb when saving, then you subset to 1000 genes and 8 samples, you would end up with a file being 1.6G.\nThat is not nice, so I decided to play around. I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to read our code, because contains a lot of information, but feel free: subset. I value your time, so this is a dummy example.\nThe examples mainly creates different objects:\n dummyBig: 10K genes, 100 samples dummySmall: 500 genes, 5 samples dummySilly: subset of dummyBig using a silly function to subset, same size than dummySmall dummySmart: subset of dummyBig using a smart function to subset, same size than dummySmall  We should expect that dummySilly and dummySmart have a similar size than dummySmall\u0026hellip;\nThis is the size of RDA files for each of them (size in Kb):\n   object file rdaSize objSize     dummyBig big.rda 2828.49 Kb 1588 Kb   dummySmall micro.rda 24.19 Kb 42.6 Kb   dummySilly microSilly.rda 4397.49 Kb 43.2 Kb   dummySmart microSmart.rda 22.38 Kb 43.2 Kb    rdaSize is the size of the file using save(obj, file = fileName.rda function. objSize is the size in memory in R using the function format(object.size(obj))\nAs you can see, microSilly is almost twice the original data, but microSmart is the expected size.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know the exact reason, but the chunk of code that made the trick was to create an internal function to be called inside the method to re-generate the DESeq2 object with the smaller size.\nI know there should be a better way to avoid this, but this worked.

SP140 is one such bromodomain- and plant homeodomain (PHD)-containing reader with immune-restricted expression, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within SP140 associate with Crohn's disease (CD). However, the function of SP140 and the consequences of disease-associated SP140 SNPs have remained unclear. We show that SP140 is critical for transcriptional programs that uphold the macrophage state. SP140 preferentially occupies promoters of silenced, lineage-inappropriate genes bearing the histone modification H3K27me3, such as the HOXA cluster in human macrophages, and ensures their repression. Depletion of SP140 in mouse or human macrophages resulted in severely compromised microbe-induced activation. We reveal that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or B cells from individuals carrying CD-associated SNPs within SP140 have defective SP140 messenger RNA splicing and diminished SP140 protein levels. Moreover, CD patients carrying SP140 SNPs displayed suppressed innate immune gene signatures in a mixed population of PBMCs that stratified them from other CD patients. Hematopoietic-specific knockdown of Sp140 in mice resulted in exacerbated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and low SP140 levels in human CD intestinal biopsies correlated with relatively lower intestinal innate cytokine levels and improved response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Thus, the epigenetic reader SP140 is a key regulator of macrophage transcriptional programs for cellular state, and a loss of SP140 due to genetic variation contributes to a molecularly defined subset of CD characterized by ineffective innate immunity, normally critical for intestinal homeostasis.","tags":null,"title":"Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kenneth Daily","Shannan J.

However, optimized use of iPSC depends on our ability to develop methods to efficiently qualify cell lines and protocols, monitor genetic stability, and evaluate self-renewal and differentiation potential. To accomplish these goals, 57 stem cell lines from 10 laboratories were differentiated to 7 different states, resulting in 248 analyzed samples. Cell lines were differentiated and characterized at a central laboratory using standardized cell culture methodologies, protocols, and metadata descriptors. Stem cell and derived differentiated lines were characterized using RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, copy number arrays, DNA methylation arrays, flow cytometry, and molecular histology. All materials, including raw data, metadata, analysis and processing code, and methodological and provenance documentation are publicly available for re-use and interactive exploration at https://www.synapse.org/pcbc.

The Infinium covered slightly more protein coding, cancer-associated and mitochondrial-related genes, both platforms covered all known imprinting clusters, and rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing covered more microRNA genes than the HumanMethylation450, but fewer than the MethylationEPIC. Rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing did not always interrogate exactly the same CpG loci, but genomic tiling improved overlap between different libraries. Reproducibility of rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and concordance between the platforms increased with CpG density. Only rapid multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing could genotype samples and measure allele-specific methylation, and we confirmed that Infinium measurements are influenced by nearby single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

Of the different types of small RNAs, the most important in mammals are miRNA, tRNA fragments and piRNAs. The advantage of small RNA-seq analysis is that we can study all small RNA types simultaneously, with the potential to detect novel small RNAs. bcbio-nextgen is a community- developed Python framework that implements best practices for next-generation sequence data analysis and uses gold standard data for validation. We have extended bcbio to include a small RNA-seq analysis pipeline that performs quality control, removal of adapter contamination, annotation of miRNA, isomiRs and tRNAs, novel miRNA discovery, and genome-wide characterization of other types of small RNAs. The pipeline integrates tools such as miRDeep2, seqbuster, seqcluster and tdrMapper to facilitate annotation to small RNA categories. It produces an R Markdown template that helps with downstream statistical analyses in R, including quality control metrics and best practices for differential expression and clustering analyses. Finally, the pipeline generates an interactive HTML-based browser for visualization purposes. This is useful for characterizing novel small RNA types, working with non-model organisms, or providing a general profiling description. This browser shows the small RNA regions along with their genomic annotation, expression profile over the precursor, secondary structure, and the top expressed sequences. Here, we show the capabilities of the pipeline and validation using data from the miRQC project. We show that the quantification accuracy is around 95% for miRNAs. We obtained similar results for other types of small RNA molecules, demonstrating that we can reliably detect small RNAs without a dependency on specific databases.","tags":[],"title":"Characterization of the small RNA transcriptome using the bcbio-nextgen python framework","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In summary: I will show which is the best miRNA mapping tool. I used several options for this benchmarking:\n miraligner from SeqBuster suit (I am one of the authors) bowtie2 and bowtie novoalign from novocraft suit GEM srnabench microrazer STAR miRExpress  I think that these are the most used, and other not used but good to try them. They were clearly developed for other purposes, but as well, they generate the input of many miRNA pipelines. I just wanted to know how well my tool was doing. The first aim to develop miraligner was to get annotated additions of nucleotides at the end of miRNA sequences, something that is very common in mirna biogenesis: isomirs and often they are missed by short read and fast mappers. I have a repository for this kind of things, so anybody can reproduce my results, and check if I did something wrong, or comment on it. In this post I just want to know which tool detects more miRNA, for that I did two main steps:\n simulate a bunch of miRNAs (isomirs) with my python script that is part of SeqBuster suit. I generated around 10000 sequences. Normally, one small-RNAseq library produces around half million different sequences. use only miRBase human precursors as reference genome  I used default parameter for all, so probably there is a set of parameters that would be better for some tools, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t search for them this time (happy to accept issues to add them). The results are:\n miraligner and STAR map more sequences. miraligner loses sequences shorter than 15 nt, normally (miRNA) are around 21, and those sequences map to repeat elements STAR is the best mapping, but need some parsing to reduce false positive. I think that pipelines should change to this tool. GEM has problems with additions and nt substitutions in many cases, same as novoaligner (I will look at this in the future) bowtie2/bowtie is the second that annotated most (and best) microrazer has a problem with mismatches, but maybe there is some parameter to trick miRExpress with default options only will map perfect matches sequences to precursor, so strongly recommended to allow errors to increase sensibility.  I have to say that the advantage of miraligner is that it gives you the sequence annotated as miRNA or precursor, and gives you the exactly modifications that sequences have if they are compared to miRBase database. And you could feed the results to my R package to plot isomers distribution of samples from different groups, and do differential expression analysis with DESeq2, or another tool. I didn\u0026rsquo;t add time consumption because all of them run in a couple of minutes. In my next post I will focus in the the correct annotation of each sequence, and the possible problems with cross-mapping events, when the sequence comes from another regions of the genome but map to miRBase precursor as well [see my previous post for more details]. As well I will use STAR with the full genome and see if the mapping continues being the best. In that case I will add a script to SeqBuster to parse the output of STAR for those who can map with STAR (need up to 32G for human genome)\n","date":1458863341,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1458863341,"objectID":"668958435b87a09c9705e59cf5eaabc9","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/post/legacy/2016-03-24-mirna-annotation-tools-comparison/","publishdate":"2016-03-24T19:49:01-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/legacy/2016-03-24-mirna-annotation-tools-comparison/","section":"post","summary":"In summary: I will show which is the best miRNA mapping tool.

We have used our tool to characterize and profile sRNAs in post-mortem brain samples of control individuals and Parkinson's disease (PD) cases at early-premotor and late-symptomatic stages. RESULTS: Clusters of co-expressed sRNAs mapping onto tRNAs significantly separated premotor and motor cases from controls. A similar result was obtained using a matrix of miRNAs slightly varying in sequence (isomiRs). The present framework revealed sRNA alterations at premotor stages of PD, which might reflect initial pathogenic perturbations.

Yet, hundreds of RNA molecules remain in mature sperm. The biological significance of the vast majority of these molecules is unclear. To better understand the processes that generate sperm small RNAs and what roles they may have, we sequenced and characterized the small RNA content of sperm samples from two human fertile individuals. We detected 182 microRNAs, some of which are highly abundant. The most abundant microRNA in sperm is miR-1246 with predicted targets among sperm-specific genes. The most abundant class of small noncoding RNAs in sperm are PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Surprisingly, we found that human sperm cells contain piRNAs processed from pseudogenes. Clusters of piRNAs from human testes contain pseudogenes transcribed in the antisense strand and processed into small RNAs. Several human protein-coding genes contain antisense predicted targets of pseudogene-derived piRNAs in the male germline and these piRNAs are still found in mature sperm. Our study provides the most extensive data set and annotation of human sperm small RNAs to date and is a resource for further functional studies on the roles of sperm small RNAs. In addition, we propose that some of the pseudogene-derived human piRNAs may regulate expression of their parent gene in the male germline.","tags":["Humans","Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements","Male","MicroRNAs","MicroRNAs: genetics","Phylogeny","Promoter Regions","Genetic","Proteins","Proteins: metabolism","Pseudogenes","RNA","Small Interfering","RNA","Small Interfering: genetics","RNA","Small Interfering: metabolism","Sequence Analysis","RNA","Sequence Analysis","RNA: methods","Spermatozoa","Spermatozoa: metabolism","Testis","Testis: metabolism","selected"],"title":"The small RNA content of human sperm reveals pseudogene-derived piRNAs complementary to protein-coding genes.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Puig","David Castellano","Lorena Pantano","Carla Giner-Delgado","David Izquierdo","Magdalena Gayà-Vidal","José Ignacio Lucas-Lledó","Tõnu Esko","Chikashi Terao","Fumihiko Matsuda","Mario Cáceres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"4cae951b1a5664dd92393a5468950c86","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/puig-2015/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:14:44.089904Z","relpermalink":"/publication/puig-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite many years of study into inversions, very little is known about their functional consequences, especially in humans. A common hypothesis is that the selective value of inversions stems in part from their effects on nearby genes, although evidence of this in natural populations is almost nonexistent. Here we present a global analysis of a new 415-kb polymorphic inversion that is among the longest ones found in humans and is the first with clear position effects. This inversion is located in chromosome 19 and has been generated by non-homologous end joining between blocks of transposable elements with low identity. PCR genotyping in 541 individuals from eight different human populations allowed the detection of tag SNPs and inversion genotyping in multiple populations worldwide, showing that the inverted allele is mainly found in East Asia with an average frequency of 4.7%. Interestingly, one of the breakpoints disrupts the transcription factor gene ZNF257, causing a significant reduction in the total expression level of this gene in lymphoblastoid cell lines. RNA-Seq analysis of the effects of this expression change in standard homozygotes and inversion heterozygotes revealed distinct expression patterns that were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, we have found a new fusion transcript that is generated exclusively from inverted chromosomes around one of the breakpoints. Finally, by the analysis of the associated nucleotide variation, we have estimated that the inversion was generated ̃40,000-50,000 years ago and, while a neutral evolution cannot be ruled out, its current frequencies are more consistent with those expected for a deleterious variant, although no significant association with phenotypic traits has been found so far.","tags":null,"title":"Functional Impact and Evolution of a Novel Human Polymorphic Inversion That Disrupts a Gene and Creates a Fusion Transcript","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anita Öst","Adelheid Lempradl","Eduard Casas","Melanie Weigert","Theodor Tiko","Merdin Deniz","Lorena Pantano","Ulrike Boenisch","Pavel M.

In addition, it includes data on experimental validation, population frequency, functional effects and evolutionary history. All this information is readily accessible through a complete and user-friendly web report for each inversion. In its current version, InvFEST combines information from 34 different studies and contains 1092 candidate inversions, which are categorized based on internal scores and manual curation.

Thermodynamic features of the duplex appear to play an important role in this decision; the strand with the weakest binding at its 5'-end is more likely to become the guide strand. Other key characteristics of human miRNA guide strands are a U-bias at the 5'-end and an excess of purines, whereas the passenger strands have a C-bias at the 5'-end and an excess of pyrimidines. Several proteins are known to play a role in strand selection [Ago (Argonaute), DICER, TRBP (trans-activation response RNA-binding protein), PACT (protein activator of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase) and Xrn-1/2]; however, the mechanisms by which these proteins act are largely unknown. For several miRNAs the miR/miR* ratio varies dependent on cell type, developmental stage and in different disease states, suggesting that strand selection is a tightly controlled process.

Everybody is using it to annotate small RNA sequences as miRNA or not. And it is great, and very helpfully\u0026hellip;but there are some cases that we should investigate our results.\nFor instance, what happens with miR-1246? it is a recent miRNA, primate specific, detected by sequencing in different studies (1,2,3). The counts related to these sequences are not so high, actually very low after normalization, but still are there. miRBase gives a precursor this region: chr2: 177465708-177465780 [-]\n  Fig 1: mir1246   We see that there is a repeat element (ERV, retrovirus) and also it is a pretty conserved region. Until here, everything allright. But, I realized some time ago, annotating some data that I had, that the mature miRNA annotates in other regions:\n  chr:start-end strand type conservation chr13:21,186,304-21,186,473 + U2 human chr14:96,850,961-96,851,148 + U2 rhesus chr5:157,403,780-157,403,964 - U2 rhesus chr6:89,773,226-89,773,409 - U2 rhesus chr13:46,948,540-46,948,725 - U2 rhesus chr3:127,793,920-127,794,092 - U2 rhesus chr2:177,465,708-177,465,780 - miR-1246 rhesus,mouse,dog,elephant    All of them are copies of a RNA repeat according RepBase, specifically the snRNA U2 class (150-200 nt). In addition, I got much more reads inside those (extra) locations than inside the annotated precursor (3 orders bigger). Furthermore, all of them had a peak in their coverage profile (fig 2).\n  Fig 2:Reads coverage of U2   The question that arises now: is this a real miRNA, or a sub-product, or both? with any function? Maybe there is more than one precursor, or maybe it is a miRNA-like snRNA. Moreover, the secondary structure of these U2 is very similar to a miRNA precursor hairpin (fig 3).\n  Fig 3:U2 secondary structure   One cause of this annotation could be that the unique precursor conserved beyond primates is the one mentioned in miRBase, while the other U2 locations are primate-specific. Extra analyses should be done to reveal the real nature of this miRNA. Results suggest that, either the miRNA has more than one precursor, or a sub-product, or both.\nAs an extra-analysis, I took public data, KO Dicer and control, of HELA cells (GSM769512) to study the dependency od these sequences to DICER. You expect a decrease in the number of counts of miRNA sequences, between control and KO dicer. The exact miRNA sequence decrease 1/3 in KO dicer cells, assuming a Dicer dependency, and take this sequence as a real miRNA. But, we have a lot of other sequences in the U2 regions, but not in the annotated precursor, and only differ in one extra nucleotide (Adenosine) at the beginning (miR-1246: AAUGGAUUUUUGGAGCAGG and U2: AAAUGGAUUUUUGGAGCAGG).This sequence can be annotated as miR-1246 if you allow 1 mismatch in the alignment (the A nt). This sequence had the same counts in normal cells and KO cells, suggesting that sequences from U2 are not Dicer-dependent. Summarizing, we have the mature annotated miRNA mapping in all these positions, and in addition, we have other sequences (one nt longer), that only map in the U2 positions. So, how we can differentiate what proportion of sequences comes from the precursors and what comes from the other positions? Well, one possibility is to detect the precursor by PCR in your samples, to assume that at least it is there, or try to see whether the coverage in the different locations makes sense more with one scenario or another\u0026hellip;Or maybe it is not a big deal, you have this small RNA, the question is whether it has any regulatory function or not.\nFrom here, we may agree that it is better to double-check what is happening when annotating small RNAs, because there are many possibilities to take a wrong conclusion if you only believe in a preliminary analysis. Nowadays, data is increasing a lot, and scientists need to make a bunch of assumptions to obtain something, but be careful with those assumptions (indeed, they are needed to evolve in science) because you may be missing something else or getting something wrong or wasting your time with experiments to corroborate your computational results.\nReferences\n[1] PMID:18583537\n\u0026ldquo;MicroRNA discovery and profiling in human embryonic stem cells by deep sequencing of small RNA libraries\u0026rdquo;\nBar M, Wyman SK, Fritz BR, Qi J, Garg KS, Parkin RK, Kroh EM, Bendoraite A, Mitchell PS, Nelson AM, Ruzzo WL, Ware C, Radich JP, Gentleman R, Ruohola-Baker H, Tewari M\nStem Cells. 26:2496-2505(2008).\n[2] PMID:20300190\n\u0026ldquo;Characterization of the Melanoma miRNAome by Deep Sequencing\u0026rdquo;\nStark MS, Tyagi S, Nancarrow DJ, Boyle GM, Cook AL, Whiteman DC, Parsons PG, Schmidt C, Sturm RA, Hayward NK\nPLoS One. 5:e9685(2010).\n[3] PMID:20459774\n\u0026ldquo;Ultra-high throughput sequencing-based small RNA discovery and discrete statistical biomarker analysis in a collection of cervical tumours and matched controls\u0026rdquo;\nWitten D, Tibshirani R, Gu SG, Fire A, Lui WO\nBMC Biol. 8:58(2010).\n","date":1369663982,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369663982,"objectID":"b2a9c80c51f7796a868c0445fa40d3e5","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/post/legacy/2013-05-27-mirna-annotation-complex-scenarios/","publishdate":"2013-05-27T10:13:02-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/legacy/2013-05-27-mirna-annotation-complex-scenarios/","section":"post","summary":"Everybody who is working with microRNA knows about miRBase, it was the first miRNA catalogue.

High-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed heterogeneity at length and sequence level for the majority of mature miRNAs (IsomiRs). Most isomiRs can be explained by variability in either Dicer1 or Drosha cleavage during miRNA biogenesis at 5' or 3' of the miRNA (trimming variants). Although isomiRs have been described in different tissues and organisms, their functional validation as modulators of gene expression remains elusive. Here we have characterized the expression and function of a highly abundant miR-101 5'-trimming variant (5'-isomiR-101).  RESULTS: The analysis of small RNA sequencing data in several human tissues and cell lines indicates that 5'-isomiR-101 is ubiquitously detected and a highly abundant, especially in the brain. 5'-isomiR-101 was found in Ago-2 immunocomplexes and complementary approaches showed that 5'-isomiR-101 interacted with different members of the silencing (RISC) complex. In addition, 5'-isomiR-101 decreased the expression of five validated miR-101 targets, suggesting that it is a functional variant. Both the binding to RISC members and the degree of silencing were less efficient for 5'-isomiR-101 compared with miR-101. For some targets, both miR-101 and 5'-isomiR-101 significantly decreased protein expression with no changes in the respective mRNA levels. Although a high number of overlapping predicted targets suggest similar targeted biological pathways, a correlation analysis of the expression profiles of miR-101 variants and predicted mRNA targets in human brains at different ages, suggest specific functions for miR-101- and 5'-isomiR-101.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that isomiRs are functional variants and further indicate that for a given miRNA, the different isomiRs may contribute to the overall effect as quantitative and qualitative fine-tuners of gene expression.","tags":["Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor: deficiency","Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor: genetics","Argonaute Proteins","Argonaute Proteins: metabolism","Cell Line","Cyclooxygenase 2","Cyclooxygenase 2: deficiency","Cyclooxygenase 2: genetics","DEAD-box RNA Helicases","DEAD-box RNA Helicases: metabolism","Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1","Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1: deficiency","Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1: genetics","Gene Expression Regulation","Gene Expression Regulation: genetics","Gene Silencing","Humans","MicroRNAs","MicroRNAs: genetics","MicroRNAs: metabolism","Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein","Polycomb Repressive Complex 2","Polycomb Repressive Complex 2: deficiency","Polycomb Repressive Complex 2: genetics","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2: deficiency","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2: genetics","Proto-Oncogene Proteins: metabolism","RNA Isoforms","RNA Isoforms: genetics","RNA Isoforms: metabolism"],"title":"A highly expressed miR-101 isomiR is a functional silencing small RNA.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franc Llorens","Manuela Hummel","Lorena Pantano","Xavier Pastor","Ana Vivancos","Ester Castillo","Heidi Mattlin","Anna Ferrer","Matthew Ingham","Marc Noguera","Robert Kofler","Juliane C Dohm","Raquel Pluvinet","Mònica Bayés","Heinz Himmelbauer","José Antonio del Rio","Eulàlia Martí","Lauro Sumoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"949dcaf4bcf521514d358ab084c1f1c5","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/llorens-2013-a/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:14:44.100255Z","relpermalink":"/publication/llorens-2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) plays an important function in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its receptor (EGFR) and providing cancer cells with increased survival responsiveness. Signal transduction carried out by EGF has been extensively studied at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Little is known about the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the EGF signaling pathway. miRNAs have emerged as major players in the complex networks of gene regulation, and cancer miRNA expression studies have evidenced a direct involvement of miRNAs in cancer progression.  RESULTS: In this study, we have used an integrative high content analysis approach to identify the specific miRNAs implicated in EGF signaling in HeLa cells as potential mediators of cancer mediated functions. We have used microarray and deep-sequencing technologies in order to obtain a global view of the EGF miRNA transcriptome with a robust experimental cross-validation. By applying a procedure based on Rankprod tests, we have delimited a solid set of EGF-regulated miRNAs. After validating regulated miRNAs by reverse transcription quantitative PCR, we have derived protein networks and biological functions from the predicted targets of the regulated miRNAs to gain insight into the potential role of miRNAs in EGF-treated cells. In addition, we have analyzed sequence heterogeneity due to editing relative to the reference sequence (isomiRs) among regulated miRNAs.  CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the use of global genomic miRNA cross-validation derived from high throughput technologies can be used to generate more reliable datasets inferring more robust networks of co-regulated predicted miRNA target genes.","tags":["Epidermal Growth Factor","Epidermal Growth Factor: pharmacology","Gene Silencing","Gene Targeting","Genomics","Genomics: methods","HeLa Cells","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing: methods","Humans","MicroRNAs","MicroRNAs: genetics","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis: methods","Sequence Analysis","RNA","Signal Transduction","Signal Transduction: drug effects","Signal Transduction: genetics","Transcription","Genetic","Transcription","Genetic: drug effects","Transcription","Genetic: genetics"],"title":"Microarray and deep sequencing cross-platform analysis of the mirRNome and isomiR variation in response to epidermal growth factor.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I spent all my PhD working with small RNA sequences data.

The abnormally extended polyglutamine in the HTT protein encoded by the CAG repeats has toxic effects. Here, we provide evidence to support that the mutant HTT CAG repeats interfere with cell viability at the RNA level. In human neuronal cells, expanded HTT exon-1 mRNA with CAG repeat lengths above the threshold for complete penetrance (40 or greater) induced cell death and increased levels of small CAG-repeated RNAs (sCAGs), of ≈21 nucleotides in a Dicer-dependent manner. The severity of the toxic effect of HTT mRNA and sCAG generation correlated with CAG expansion length. Small RNAs obtained from cells expressing mutant HTT and from HD human brains significantly decreased neuronal viability, in an Ago2-dependent mechanism. In both cases, the use of anti-miRs specific for sCAGs efficiently blocked the toxic effect, supporting a key role of sCAGs in HTT-mediated toxicity. Luciferase-reporter assays showed that expanded HTT silences the expression of CTG-containing genes that are down-regulated in HD. These results suggest a possible link between HD and sCAG expression with an aberrant activation of the siRNA/miRNA gene silencing machinery, which may trigger a detrimental response. The identification of the specific cellular processes affected by sCAGs may provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying HD, offering opportunities to develop new therapeutic approaches.","tags":["Biology","Gene expression","Genetics and Genomics","Genomics","Molecular Biology","Molecular cell biology","Nucleic acids","RNA","Research Article"],"title":"A Pathogenic Mechanism in Huntington's Disease Involves Small CAG-Repeated RNAs with Neurotoxic Activity.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena Pantano","Xavier Estivill","Eulalia Martí"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1320105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1320105600,"objectID":"d30cf76bfa94a1f5e3c61f639b7e07bf","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/pantano-2011/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:15:28.610452Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pantano-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"MOTIVATION: Recent progress in high-throughput sequencing technologies has largely contributed to reveal a highly complex landscape of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), including novel non-canonical sRNAs derived from long non-coding RNA, repeated elements, transcription start sites and splicing site regions among others.

As a consequence, tools for the identification and classification of the sRNAs not belonging to miRNA family are currently lacking. RESULTS: Here, we present, SeqCluster, an extension of the currently available SeqBuster tool to identify and analyze at different levels the sRNAs not annotated or predicted as miRNAs. This new module deals with sequences mapping onto multiple locations and permits a highly versatile and user-friendly interaction with the data in order to easily classify sRNA sequences with a putative functional importance.

We have applied the Illumina massively parallel sequencing to deeply analyze the small RNA populations of two different forebrain areas, the frontal cortex (FC) and the striatum (ST) of healthy individuals and individuals with HD. More than 80% of the small-RNAs were annotated as microRNAs (miRNAs) in all samples. Deep sequencing revealed length and sequence heterogeneity (IsomiRs) for the vast majority of miRNAs. Around 8090% of the miRNAs presented modifications in the 3-terminus mainly in the form of trimming and/or as nucleotide addition variants, while the 5-terminus of the miRNAs was specially protected from changes. Expression profiling showed strong miRNA and isomiR expression deregulation in HD, most being common to both FC and ST. The analysis of the upstream regulatory regions in co-regulated miRNAs suggests a role for RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) and P53 in miRNAs downregulation in HD. The putative targets of deregulated miRNAs and seed-region IsomiRs strongly suggest that their altered expression contributes to the aberrant gene expression in HD. Our results show that miRNA variability is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the adult human brain, which may influence gene expression in physiological and pathological conditions.","tags":["selected"],"title":"A myriad of miRNA variants in control and Huntington's disease brain regions detected by massively parallel sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena Pantano","Xavier Estivill","Eulàlia Martí"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"99214e280ef59fcb986d23bf4117078a","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/pantano-2010/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:15:28.613997Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pantano-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"High-throughput sequencing technologies enable direct approaches to catalog and analyze snapshots of the total small RNA content of living cells.

The high flexibility of this tool is illustrated by the multiple choices offered in the pre-analysis for mapping purposes and in the different analysis modules for data manipulation.

SeqBuster integrates multiple analyses modules in a unique platform and constitutes the first bioinformatic tool offering a deep characterization of miRNA variants (isomiRs). The application of SeqBuster to small-RNA datasets of human embryonic stem cells revealed that most miRNAs present different types of isomiRs, some of them being associated to stem cell differentiation. The exhaustive description of the isomiRs provided by SeqBuster could help to identify miRNA-variants that are relevant in physiological and pathological processes.

In these experiments the frequency of reprogramming was lower than 0.1% of the infected cells, raising the possibility that additional events are required to induce reprogramming, such as activation of genes triggered by retroviral insertions. We have therefore determined by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) the retroviral insertion sites in six induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell clones derived from mouse fibroblasts. Seventy-nine insertion sites were assigned to a single mouse genome location. Thirty-five of these mapped to gene transcription units, whereas 29 insertions landed within 10 kilobases of transcription start sites. No common insertion site was detected among the iPS clones studied. Moreover, bioinformatics analyses revealed no enrichment of a specific gene function, network, or pathway among genes targeted by retroviral insertions. We conclude that Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc are sufficient to promote fibroblast-to-iPS cell reprogramming and propose that the observed low reprogramming frequencies may have alternative explanations.","tags":["Animals","Blotting","Cell Line","Computational Biology","Fibroblasts","Fibroblasts: cytology","Fibroblasts: virology","Genetic Vectors","Genetic Vectors: genetics","Humans","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors: genetics","Mice","Octamer Transcription Factor-3","Octamer Transcription Factor-3: genetics","Pluripotent Stem Cells","Pluripotent Stem Cells: cytology","Pluripotent Stem Cells: metabolism","Pluripotent Stem Cells: virology","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc: genetics","Retroviridae","Retroviridae: genetics","SOXB1 Transcription Factors","SOXB1 Transcription Factors: genetics","Southern","mypapers"],"title":"Fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells show no common retroviral vector insertions.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lluis Armengol","Sergi Villatoro","Juan R.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We have investigated the genome-wide profile of structural variation on pooled samples from the three populations studied in the HapMap project by comparative genome hybridization (CGH) in different array platforms. We have identified and experimentally validated 33 genomic loci that show significant copy number differences from one population to the other. Interestingly, we found an enrichment of genes related to environment adaptation (immune response, lipid metabolism and extracellular space) within these regions and the study of expression data revealed that more than half of the copy number variants (CNVs) translate into gene-expression differences among populations, suggesting that they could have functional consequences. In addition, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in linkage disequilibrium with the copy number alleles allowed us to detect evidences of population differentiation and recent selection at the nucleotide variation level.

This type of human variation can make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) is a targeted method to assess copy number differences for up to 40 genomic loci in one single experiment. Although specific MLPA assays can be ordered from MRC-Holland (the proprietary company of the MLPA technology), custom designs are also developed in many laboratories worldwide. After our own experience, an important drawback of custom MLPA assays is the time spent during the design of the specific oligonucleotides that are used as probes. Due to the large number of probes included in a single assay, a number of restrictions need to be met in order to maximize specificity and to increase success likelihood. Results: We have developed a web tool for facilitating and optimising custom probe design for MLPA experiments. The algorithm only requires the target sequence in FASTA format and a set of parameters, that are provided by the user according to each specific MLPA assay, to identify the best probes inside the given region. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first available tool for optimizing custom probe design of MLPA assays. The ease-of-use and speed of the algorithm dramatically reduces the turn around time of probe design. ProSeeK will become a useful tool for all laboratories that are currently using MLPA in their research projects for CNV studies.","tags":["*Internet","*User-Computer Interface","Algorithms","DNA Probes/*chemical synthesis","Humans","Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods","algorithms","dna probes","dna probes chemical synthesis","humans","internet","nucleic acid amplification techniques","nucleic acid amplification techniques methods","user computer interface"],"title":"ProSeeK: A web server for MLPA probe design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Priscila Grynberg","Thomas Abeel","Pedro Lopes","Geoff Macintyre","Lorena Pantano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"0d99c806f0c315f033ee142043aa5f36","permalink":"http://lpantano.github.io/publication/grynberg-2007/","publishdate":"2019-09-08T18:14:44.104084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grynberg-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract In this meeting report we give an overview of the 3rd International Society for Computational Biology Student Council Symposium.
