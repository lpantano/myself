      <description>&lt;p&gt;Differentially gene expression analysis with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RNA-seq&lt;/a&gt; data is quite common nowadays, and there are pretty good &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; packages for that: &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;limma::voom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DESeq2&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for that part is quite simple, being super quick to get a list of de-regulated genes. However, downstream analyses vary a lot depending on the project itself. But I found myself doing the same plots and analyses many times for different project, so I put together a bunch of plots and analyses using code from my colleagues at work (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@HSPH bioinformatics core&lt;/a&gt;) and myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many possibilities, including QC figures, but the features that seem more interesting are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plot of individual genes using multiple variables from the metadata. This would be an evolution of plotCounts function from DESeq2. Fig1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plot volcano plots labeling some genes. Fig2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clustering set of genes to find common patterns expression. Most useful for time seria data. You get as well the list of genes that follows that pattern, so you can use it for functional analysis, for instance. Fig3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note: maybe some features only available with development version&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Package available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/DEGreport.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BioC page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lpantano/mypubs/blob/master/DEG_viz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lying factor in figures</title>
      <link>http://lpantano.github.io/post/legacy/2013-08-07-lying-factor-in-figures/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the lying factor in figures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the ratio between the difference of two numbers and the difference of the visualization of those two numbers. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have two groups, each group is represented by 4 and 2. The difference between 4 and 2 is 2. Since &amp;ldquo;a picture is worth a thousand words&amp;rdquo;, someone decides to represents those groups in a figure (yes, in excel to make it worst):&lt;/p&gt;




  




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://lpantano.github.io/img/images/lyingfactor.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1000px&#34; &gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That figure shows a difference of 4 between the two groups. Since 4 is twice than 2, we have a lying factor of 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably you think that this is not happening anywhere, it is ridiculous. It is, but probably you will find one of these cases in the news every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this is happening in science as well. For instance a (Nature)Â paper which explains how authors are improving a method that analyzes NGS data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They visualised a matrix correlation of the data using one method or another (b or c).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;{{ site.url }}/assets/screen-shot-2013-08-05-at-12-15-55-pm.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2013-08-05 at 12.15.55 PM&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only read colours, you won&amp;rsquo;t see much difference, but there is. The problem was to use a different colour scale to show the same type of data. Probably they were produced separately, so the command to produce those figures (probably an R function) had to guess the scale by its own, resulting that 0.89 is equal to 0.75 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave my post here, and may say: take some time to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;source:&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2596&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2596&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visualizing science is also cool @polychart</title>
      <link>http://lpantano.github.io/post/legacy/2012-08-14-visualizing-science-is-also-cool-polychart/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my interest in science is finding new ways to visualize Big Data. Scientist are used to work with static visualization, that of course, is wonderful in the majority of the case. But it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be better dynamic visualization for exploration? Play with your data, explore, and finally when you get that great figure that tell you everything you was looking for, you can export it to an image portable format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played many time with javascript/HTML5 resources, but are no so easy to implement if you are not an expert, and some times, huge data makes difficult the easy interaction. Well, recently I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://polychart.com/&#34; title=&#34;polychart&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Polychart&lt;/a&gt;, is still in beta version, but I am using one of the feature they provide: Graph builder. And this is how it looks like after loading a file with 5000 rows and 37 columns:&lt;/p&gt;




  




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can make different type of charts, like boxplot, barplot, piechart (although aren&amp;rsquo;t well considered) etc. Also, you can customize titles and transform data. Quick complete for a beta version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally but not less important, it is free for academics. :)&lt;/p&gt;
