Last year my mom got cancer, multiple myeloma. I didn't know anything about this cancer, and I discovered how horrible it is, even if treatment is available, people get misdiagnosed all the time, and there is no cure. I am doing the marathon this year with the Jimmy fund walk event. NextRNA, the company I work for, joined as a team, and it gave me the opportunity to do something and share my story to bring awareness.

Please, if you can, add a few $$ to my fund-raising page: http://danafarber.jimmyfund.org/goto/lopantano, and/or share the link with friends. Any amount will impact people like my mom.

## June 18, 6 miles 
Chapter 01: September 2022, my mom started with some back pain and started to lose mobility. She stopped doing her normal activity.

## June 24, 7.5 miles 
Chapter 02: One month later, doctors only gave her pain medication, all kinds, nothing was working, and she was not able to walk or sit. The health system denied her any kind of imaging to evaluate further.

## July 1, 9 miles 
Chapter 03: November 2022, my mom was getting worse, not able to move at all, and starting to lose short-term memory and not able to maintain a normal conversation. After a lot of push from my dad, they got a referral from primary care to get an MRI in a private clinic. We needed to wait for 1 more week now.

## July 8, 10.5 miles
Chapter 04: In December 2022, my mom got accepted into the hospital after having results from the MRI that showed some kind of cancer inside the bones. She had broken discs and ribs. In one day we knew it was MM, protein M levels were incredibly high. At this point, she was spending all the time in bed. She was disoriented. I bought a ticket to Spain right away.
