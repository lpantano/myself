I build tools and platforms that turn complex genomic data into clear insights. My work spans from developing bioinformatics pipelines and interactive visualizations to building AI models for target discovery and mechanism of action understanding.

**What I Do:**

I have been implementing AI LLM models to increase productivity and increase accesibility of platforms to multiple departments.

- **Create Interactive Dashboards**: Design visualization platforms that make multi-omics data accessible for research teams and decision-makers
- **Develop AI Models**: Built RNA structure and RNA-protein interaction prediction engines from SHAPE-Seq and eCLIP-Seq data
- **Build Bioinformatics Tools**: tools for small RNA analysis, and developer of Nextflow pipelines for genomic data processing
- **Architect Cloud Infrastructure**: Design scalable, reproducible computational environments on AWS for genomics workflows

**Current Work:**
As Director of the Bioinformatics Platform at Harvard Chan School, I manage the core's bioinformatics pipelines and lead development of interactive visualization tools for multiple research programs.

**Consulting:**
Advisor to emerging biotech companies on computational biology strategy, data infrastructure, and bioinformatics platforms for target discovery and drug development.

**Background:**
13 years leading computational biology teams in biotech and academia, with experience spanning fibrosis research, oncology, neurodegeneration, and xenotransplantation. Track record of building teams, managing cross-functional collaborations, and delivering genomic insights that drive drug discovery decisions.

**Community Leadership:**
- Host of [A Coffee with CompBio](https://smartlink.ausha.co/a-coffee-with-compbio) podcast with [Alex Bartlett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-bartlett-926b32109/)
- Founder of [Women in Bioinformatics](https://boston-wib.org) Boston (2016-present)
- VP Board Member at [AWIS MASS](https://massawis.org/board-members-2024-2025/)
- [Nextflow Maintainer](https://www.nextflow.io/)
