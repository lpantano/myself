I build tools and platforms that turn complex genomic data into clear insights. My work focuses on developing bioinformatics pipelines, interactive visualizations, and AI models for target discovery and mechanism-of-action understanding.

**What I do**

I use large language models (including Claude and GitHub Copilot) to accelerate planning and development of the platforms I lead.

- **Create interactive dashboards** – Build visualization platforms that make multi-omics data accessible for research teams and decision-makers.
- **Build bioinformatics tools** – Develop Nextflow pipelines and custom Python and R packages for sequencing data processing.
- **Develop AI models** – Build neural network models for drug development and target discovery.
- **Architect cloud infrastructure** – Design scalable, reproducible computational environments on AWS for genomics workflows.

**Current work**
As Director of the Bioinformatics Platform at Harvard Chan School, I manage the core bioinformatics pipelines and lead development of interactive visualization tools for multiple research programs.

**Consulting**
Advisor to emerging biotech companies on computational biology strategy, data infrastructure, and bioinformatics platforms for target discovery and drug development.

**Background**
Over 13 years leading computational biology teams in biotech and academia, with experience spanning fibrosis research, oncology, neurodegeneration, and xenotransplantation. Proven track record of building teams, managing cross-functional collaborations, and delivering genomic insights that drive drug discovery decisions.

**Community leadership**
- Producer (2025–present) and host (2025 season) of the [A Coffee with CompBio](https://podcast.boston-wib.org/) podcast with [Alex Bartlett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-bartlett-926b32109/).
- Founder of [Women in Bioinformatics](https://boston-wib.org) Boston (2016–present).
- VP board member at [AWIS MASS](https://massawis.org/board-members-2024-2025/) (2025–2026).
- [Nextflow maintainer](https://www.nextflow.io/).
