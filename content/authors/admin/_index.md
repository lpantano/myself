13 years of experience working with high-dimensional genomic data, implementing new methods to interpret data for decision-making in research/development projects.
Built and managed the Illumina and Nanopore sequencing capabilities in 3 companies applying the technology to platforms for target discovery, gene editing, SHAPE-MaP and MoA projects.
8 years studying neurodegenerative diseases, and 5 years working in Oncology field.
Experience harmonizing thousands of multi-omics data in a unique dashboard for preclinical and clinical project stages. Accessed controlled raw data from NIH protected datasets (i.e. TCGA).
Built 6 bioinformatics packages commonly used nowadays by the open-source community.
Managed a team of five scientists and engineers to build and maintain compute infrastructure, reproducible analyses and data sharing with interactive web-apps.
Managed efficiently cloud computing and storage infrastructure with AWS services, PostIt (Rstudio) and Nextflow Seqera.
