## Description

Most of us learned how to do our jobs, but nobody taught us how to actually work with our managers. And here's the thing: your relationship with your manager can be the difference between feeling stuck and advancing your career – but only if you understand what's really going on in their world.

This video flips the script on how you think about your manager. Instead of seeing them as someone who just assigns tasks or approves time off, we're showing you how to think of them as your business partner. Because when you understand their pressures, priorities, and what success looks like for them, you can position yourself as someone who makes their life easier – and that's when doors start opening for you.
