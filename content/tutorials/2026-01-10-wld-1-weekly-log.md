## Description

Welcome to our first episode! Today we're diving into something that sounds deceptively simple but is genuinely career-changing: keeping a weekly log of your wins and quantifying your achievements. This isn't just for performance review season (though it's a lifesaver then) – it's your secret weapon for fighting imposter syndrome, building an impressive resume, and having concrete evidence ready when it's time to negotiate that raise. Five minutes every Friday. That's all it takes.

We've created a one-page Quick Reference Guide (download below!) that you can print and keep at your desk. It covers why this matters, what to log, how to quantify your impact with real before/after examples, and practical setup tips. No more scrambling to remember what you accomplished six months ago. No more underselling yourself because you forgot the numbers. Just a simple habit that pays dividends for years to come.

Watch the video, grab your guide, and start your first weekly win log this Friday. Seriously – set that 5-minute calendar reminder right now. Your future self (especially the one negotiating salary or updating their resume) will thank you. Drop a comment and let us know what system you're using – Notion? Google Doc? Notes app? We'd love to hear what works for you!

Happy logging! 📊 – Lorena & Lina
