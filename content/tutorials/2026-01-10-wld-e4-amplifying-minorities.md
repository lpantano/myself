## Description

Allyship isn't passive—it requires specific, intentional actions in the moments that matter.

In this video, Lorena and I break down the practical strategies for amplifying underrepresented voices in professional settings. We're talking about real, in-the-moment tactics you can use:

✅ How to redirect attention when good ideas get talked over
✅ Strategic ways to prep colleagues before high-stakes meetings
✅ What to say (exactly) when you need to create space for others
✅ How to use your social capital without being performative

This isn't about grand gestures—it's about the small, consistent actions that actually move the needle. Whether you're in a position of privilege or you're figuring out how to advocate for yourself, these strategies work.

As always, your support makes this content possible. Thanks for being here.

Lina & Lorena
