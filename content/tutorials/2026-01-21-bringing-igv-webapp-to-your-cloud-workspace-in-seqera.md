You just ran a genomic pipeline that generated 50GB of BAM files in the cloud. Now you need to check alignment quality. Do you really have to download everything to run IGV locally? Switch virtual machines to load the files? Write code to generate static visuals?

This integration brings IGV directly to your cloud workspace with automatic track discovery. It scans your storage, finds all genomic files, and presents them in a ready-to-load menu. No downloads, no file paths, no manual configuration.
