## Description

Reviewing 100+ papers for Health Integrity Project taught me: consistency beats speed. Custom AI commands now run identical evaluations every time—same conflict checks, same quality criteria, same workflow.

Result: 30min reviews, zero missed steps, reproducible standards. Works for any systematic workflow you repeat.
