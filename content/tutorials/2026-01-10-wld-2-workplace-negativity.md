## Description

You know that colleague who turns every conversation into a complaint session? Or the team meeting that devolves into gossip and finger-pointing?

We've all been there. And here's what nobody tells you: you don't have to fix it, but you do need a strategy to handle it.

In this video, we break down:

Why you're not responsible for being everyone's emotional dumping ground

The 3-step framework for handling chronic complainers (without being dismissive)

How to redirect gossip and drama toward actual solutions

The language that transforms negative energy in real-time

How to set boundaries that protect your own mental space

The reality? Negativity spreads like wildfire in workplaces. But the good news is that positivity is just as contagious—when you know how to lead it.

This isn't about toxic positivity or pretending problems don't exist. It's about separating legitimate work issues from drama, and knowing exactly what to say when someone starts spiraling.
