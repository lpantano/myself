## Description

Hey everyone!

Lorena and I just finished recording something we WISH we'd had when we were starting out: a comprehensive guide to nailing bioinformatics interviews for junior to intermediate roles.

It's a lot. And most people prepare by trying to memorize every tool and algorithm, which honestly isn't what interviewers are looking for.
