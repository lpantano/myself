## Description

Job searching is already exhausting enough without spending hours customizing every application, researching every company, and second-guessing every follow-up email.

So in this video, we're diving into something really practical: how to use AI as your personal interview prep assistant.

Lorena interviews Lina about her AI-powered process—from the moment she sees a job posting to after the interview is over. This isn't theoretical advice. These are the actual strategies Lina is using right now during her active job search to:

✅ Cut application prep time from an hour to 20 minutes
✅ Show up to interviews with strategic questions tailored to each specific interviewer
✅ Research companies and roles more thoroughly than anyone could manually
✅ Process interview feedback and build professional networks systematically
