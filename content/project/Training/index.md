## Key Features

- **Multi-source Data Integration**: Combines data from Apple Health and Garmin Connect
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Track adaptations in speed, distance, time, and heart rate over time
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React.js for a smooth user experience
- **Data Ownership Focus**: Demonstrates how individuals can take control of their health data

## Technical Approach

This dashboard emphasizes the importance of:
- Personal data ownership and management
- Standardized data export formats
- Independent data analysis capabilities
- User empowerment over corporate data silos

## What It Shows

The dashboard tracks my personal training progress, revealing patterns in:
- Speed improvements over time
- Distance progression
- Heart rate adaptation
- Training consistency

Future enhancements will correlate this data with broader health insights to provide a more comprehensive view of fitness and well-being.

## Why This Matters

Too often, our personal health data is locked in proprietary apps or leveraged by large corporations. This project advocates for:
- Apps offering data export in standardized formats
- Individual control over personal data
- Informed decision-making through accessible analytics
- Independence from vendor lock-in
