# Validation Questions

## Question 1
Does the post clearly explain why the 180 spm recommendation is problematic without being condescending to readers who believed it?

## Question 2
Are the research findings and formula presented in a way that general readers (non-scientists) can understand and actually use?

## Question 3
Does the post balance being critical of oversimplified app recommendations while still providing actionable, practical guidance for runners?

## Answers

### Answer 1: Tone Check
The post should:
- Acknowledge 180 spm is widespread (not blame readers for believing it)
- Explain the origin (1984 Olympic study) factually
- Show why context matters (different bodies, different paces)
- Frame as "apps oversimplify" not "you're wrong"

**Approach:** Lead with curiosity and personal experience ("I wondered why my cadence varied"). This positions reader and author as discovering together rather than author lecturing.

### Answer 2: Formula Accessibility
The formula uses two variables readers can obtain:
- **Leg length:** Explain how to measure (ground to hip joint, or use height proxy)
- **Speed:** Show how to convert from running app pace (min/mile or min/km to m/s)

**Make it practical:**
- Provide step-by-step conversion examples
- Offer simple calculator approach
- Show example: "If you're 170cm tall with 85cm legs, running at 5 min/km (3.33 m/s)..."
- Result should show a range, not exact number

**Avoid:** Heavy statistics jargon. Focus on "if you know X and Y, you can estimate Z."

### Answer 3: Constructive Criticism Balance
**Critical elements (apps/universal recommendations):**
- Apps use 180 because it's simple, not because it's accurate
- One-size-fits-all approach misses important factors
- Based on limited research context

**Actionable guidance:**
- Here's how to estimate your range
- Pay attention to what feels efficient at your pace
- Cadence should change with speed (that's normal!)
- Don't obsess over exact numbers

**Tone:** "Apps are a useful tool, but understanding the nuance helps you use them better" not "apps are lying to you."
