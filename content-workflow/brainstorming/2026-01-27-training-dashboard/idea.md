# Post Idea: Training Dashboard Project

## Target Audience
General Public - "The Data in Your Life"
Specifically: Data-curious runners who wear watches but don't deeply explore the data beyond run summaries

## Core Problem
Fitness apps show individual run metrics and weekly summaries, but individual numbers mean nothing without seeing the bigger picture over time. Context matters more than numbers.

## Main Insight
Long-term trends reveal what weekly stats hide. When following a structured training program (Tactic Method), the data showed clear changes compared to unstructured running - but only when viewing months of data together, not weekly snapshots.

Accumulation of every day works helps me to keep being motivated and giving me that push when I am low in energy to continue doing it, because I have done so much already. I just need to keep going.

## Personal Motivation
- Own my data without subscriptions
- See if structured training actually works by comparing real data across training blocks
- Built as a scientist who codes for analysis, adapting familiar tools (Python for data, React for visualization) to a new domain

## What Readers Will Do
Try building something similar with your project as a starting point. GitHub repo shared as foundation and inspiration that readers can customize for their situation.

## Key Challenge to Address
Technical setup complexity - readers might worry the tools are too complicated. Will address by focusing on concepts and what you learned rather than step-by-step code instructions.

I will propose to help whoever has garmin data and wants something similar.

## Tone
- Honest about your journey (scientist coding outside their comfort zone)
- Focus on why context matters, not selling a product
- Encouraging without hype
- Show real examples from your data
