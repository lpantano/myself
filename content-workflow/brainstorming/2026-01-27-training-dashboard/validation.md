# Validation Questions

These questions help refine the content before writing the final draft.

## Question 1: Does this post serve the target audience without excluding them?

**Context**: The target is "data-curious runners" who wear watches but don't explore data deeply. The post needs to encourage exploration without requiring technical expertise.

**What to validate**:
- Is the technical complexity appropriately acknowledged without being dismissive?
- Does the post empower readers to start rather than overwhelm them?
- Are examples relatable to average runners, not just data scientists?

## Question 2: Does the core message balance two insights effectively?

**Context**: The post has two key messages:
1. Context matters more than numbers (long-term trends reveal what weekly stats hide)
2. Seeing accumulated effort motivates you to keep going when energy is low

**What to validate**:
- Do both messages get equal weight, or does one overshadow the other?
- Is the connection between them clear (long-term view enables seeing accumulation)?
- Does the motivation insight feel like a natural discovery rather than a forced addition?
- Does emphasizing accumulated effort contradict the "ignore daily feedback" message, or complement it?

## Question 3: Does the offer to help feel genuine and not burdensome?

**Context**: You're offering to help readers set up their own dashboards if they have Garmin data. This is personal and generous, but needs to feel authentic and sustainable.

**What to validate**:
- Is the offer specific enough (Garmin users) without being limiting?
- Does it feel like a genuine invitation rather than an obligation?
- Is it clear how readers should reach out (email, GitHub, social)?
- Should there be any caveats about your availability or what "help" means?
- Does the offer align with the tone of the post (encouraging, not salesy)?
