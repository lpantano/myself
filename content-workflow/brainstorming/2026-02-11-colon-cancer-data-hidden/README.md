# Post: What the Cancer Data Isn't Telling You

## Status
Brainstorming phase - ready to move to outline development

## Summary
Using American Cancer Society data on cancer deaths in people under 50, this post reveals how the same raw numbers can tell completely different stories depending on how you break down the data. Colon and breast cancer appear equally deadly in headline statistics, but adding sex to the analysis shows breast cancer affects almost exclusively women (50% of population), while colon cancer affects both sexes. The lesson: context is essential to understanding data.

## Key Assets
- Original WSJ chart (colon cancer data without demographic breakdown)
- Custom chart showing sex-stratified data (your visualization)
- Both use the same source: American Cancer Society, 2025

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete brainstorming folder with idea, research, outline, validation
2. → Move to social-media-ready phase
3. → Write final post copy
4. → Create Instagram post (general public)
5. → Create LinkedIn/Bluesky/Mastodon post (scientists)
6. → Generate quote card image
7. → Publish to website + social

## Tone Notes
- Amicable and encouraging (not alarmist)
- Focus on data literacy and critical thinking
- Avoid shame/blame language
- Empower readers to ask better questions

## Audience
General Public ("The Data in Your Life")
