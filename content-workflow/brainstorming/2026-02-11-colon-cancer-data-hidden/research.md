# Research & Sources

## Primary Source
- **American Cancer Society**: Estimated Cancer Deaths data for people under 50 (2025)
- Data shown in WSJ article: "Colorectal Cancer Is Now the Top Cause of Cancer Death in Younger People" (January 2025)

## Data Points
- **Colon & Rectum Cancer**: ~2,200 deaths (males ~1,200, females ~1,000)
- **Breast Cancer**: ~3,600 deaths (females ~3,600, males minimal)
- **Lung & Bronchus**: ~1,800 deaths (mixed)
- **Prostate**: ~100 deaths (males only)

## Key Insight
Colon cancer affects people of all sexes, but breast cancer is predominantly a female disease by the numbers. Same total death count, different population impact.

## Visual Evidence
- WSJ chart shows raw numbers without demographic breakdown
- Custom chart breaks down by sex, revealing the disparity
- Both use same data source (American Cancer Society)

## Narrative Arc
1. Show the original chart (similar numbers)
2. Reveal the sex breakdown (completely different story)
3. Explain why context matters
