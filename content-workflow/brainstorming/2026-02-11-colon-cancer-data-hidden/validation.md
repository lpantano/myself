# Validation Questions

## Question 1: Is the data insight actually surprising and meaningful?

**Question**: Does breaking down breast cancer vs. colon cancer by sex reveal something genuinely important that people wouldn't otherwise know?

**Answer**: Yes. Most people see "colon cancer #1, breast cancer #2" and think they're equally dangerous across the population. The revelation that breast cancer affects almost exclusively women (50% of population = 100% of deaths) while colon cancer affects both sexes is genuinely important. It reframes how we should think about relative risk and demographic disparity. This isn't obvious from the raw numbers.

**Validation**: ✅ The insight is both surprising and actionable.

## Question 2: Are we making a claim we can back up with the source data?

**Question**: Can we definitively say from the American Cancer Society data that breast cancer deaths are "almost entirely female"?

**Answer**: Yes. The data shows: Breast cancer ~3,600 deaths in people under 50 (2025), with female deaths accounting for essentially all of them. Male breast cancer deaths are statistically negligible. Same source (American Cancer Society) that was cited in the WSJ article. We're not inferring—we're breaking down the same data in a different way.

**Validation**: ✅ The claim is directly supported by the source data.

## Question 3: Does this resonate with the "general public" audience and avoid doom-mongering?

**Question**: Will this feel like fear-mongering or appropriately educational about data literacy?

**Answer**: The frame is explicitly NOT about fear. The message is: "This isn't about fear. It's about context." The focus is on data literacy—teaching people how to ask better questions of data, not terrifying them about cancer. We're using cancer statistics as the vehicle to teach the principle that demographics matter. The tone is curious and empowering ("the right questions"), not alarmist.

**Validation**: ✅ Tone is appropriate and aligns with project values (amicable, encouraging, educational).
