# Idea: What the Cancer Data Isn't Telling You

## Core Insight
Cancer death charts often show colon cancer and breast cancer as similarly deadly to young adults. But breaking the data down by sex reveals a critical pattern: breast cancer deaths are almost exclusively female, while colon cancer affects both sexes. This means women—50% of the population—account for nearly 100% of breast cancer deaths. Understanding who is affected changes how we interpret the data.

## Why It Matters (General Public)
People read health statistics without considering demographic breakdowns. This post teaches viewers that the same number can hide different truths depending on what context you're asking for. It's about critical data literacy.

## Angle
Data without context is incomplete. Same numbers, completely different stories depending on whether you look at total deaths or deaths per demographic group.

## Target Audience
General Public ("The Data in Your Life")

## Key Takeaway
The data is only as honest as the questions you ask it. Raw totals can obscure important patterns about who is affected.
