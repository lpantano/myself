# Outline: What the Cancer Data Isn't Telling You

## Hook
"This cancer chart is hiding something"

## Section 1: The Surface Level (The Problem)
- Headlines say: colon cancer is the #1 cause of cancer death in young adults
- Breast cancer is right behind it
- Gray bars, similar heights—seems straightforward
- But this misses a critical layer

## Section 2: Adding One Question Changes Everything (The Reveal)
- When you add sex to the data, the story shifts
- Breast cancer: ~2,000 deaths, almost entirely female
- Colon cancer: ~2,000 deaths, affects both sexes
- Women are 50% of the population...
- ...but represent nearly ALL breast cancer deaths

## Section 3: Why This Matters (The Insight)
- Raw numbers can hide demographic patterns
- Context isn't optional—it's essential
- Two cancers with similar totals tell completely different stories
- Same data source, different questions = different truths

## Closer
Data always has more to say. You just need to ask the right questions.
