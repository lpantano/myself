## Status: Social Media Ready ✓

All content completed and refined based on validation questions.

## Files in This Folder

- **post.md** - Final draft of blog post (ready for Hugo frontmatter)
- **validation.md** - 3 validation questions with answers and refinements applied
- **metadata.md** - SEO keywords, meta description, tags, key quotes
- **social-instagram.txt** - Instagram post (122 chars, under "more" limit)
- **social-linkedin.txt** - LinkedIn/Bluesky/Mastodon post (same for all three)

## Key Findings Highlighted

1. **Garmin zones are percentile rankings** - comparing users to all other Garmin users via fixed thresholds
2. **Contradictory design choice** - Garmin acknowledges height affects cadence but doesn't adjust zones
3. **50% is individual variation** - research shows half of cadence is unmeasurable unique factors
4. **Simple decision rule** - if you're orange/green and feel good, you're fine

## Post Structure

1. **Intro**: Personal experience with orange zone anxiety
2. **Section 1**: What the colors actually mean (percentile rankings)
3. **Section 2**: Garmin's contradiction (admits height matters, ignores it)
4. **Section 3**: What research shows (4 key findings)
5. **Section 4**: The 180 myth's persistence
6. **Section 5**: Actionable advice with simple decision rule
7. **Conclusion**: Data literacy lesson

## Refinements Applied

Based on validation questions:
- ✓ Added explicit clarification that percentiles are fixed thresholds
- ✓ Strengthened Section 2 to emphasize the design choice (not just oversight)
- ✓ Added simple decision rule: "If orange/green and feel good, you're fine"
- ✓ All in-text citations now clickable links to DOI pages
- ✓ Interactive calculator added for readers to calculate their own expected cadence
