# Reel Script: What the Cancer Data Isn't Telling You

**Duration**: 60 seconds

---

## HOOK (0-5s)
[Text overlay on original gray bar chart]

**Text**: "This data chart is hiding something"

---

## SETUP (5-15s)
[Your voice/text over charts]

**Narration**: "The American Cancer Society shows colon cancer kills the most young people, followed closely by breast cancer. Same gray bars, similar numbers."

[Visual]: Show original WSJ-style chart with colon cancer and breast cancer bars

---

## REVEAL (15-35s)
[Transition to your custom chart with sex breakdown]

**Narration**: "But when you add sex to the data, the story changes.

Breast cancer: ~2,000 deaths, almost entirely female.
Colon cancer: ~2,000 deaths, affects both sexes.

Women are half the population. But we represent nearly ALL breast cancer deaths—matching a cancer that affects everyone."

[Visual]: Split screen or transition showing:
- Left: Original gray bars
- Right: Your sex-stratified chart with color breakdown (purple for male, yellow for female)

---

## INSIGHT (35-50s)
[Back to you speaking to camera or text overlay]

**Narration**: "The data was honest. It just wasn't complete.

Same numbers. Completely different story.

That's why context matters."

[Visual]: Cycle through both charts, highlighting the difference

## Production Notes

**Tone**: Curious, not alarmist. Focus on data literacy, not fear.

**Pacing**: Let each revelation sink in. Don't rush the "reveal" section.

**Visuals**:
- Start with the original WSJ/ACS gray bar chart
- Transition to your custom chart that breaks down by sex
- Both charts visible for comparison

**Music**: Upbeat but not dramatic. Build slightly at "the story changes" reveal.

**Text Size**: Large enough to read on mobile without stopping the video.

**Color Strategy**: Use the same color scheme from your custom chart (purple = male, yellow = female) to maintain visual consistency.
