I built a dashboard to track my running data because fitness apps showed weekly summaries, but real training adaptations happen over months.

Key insight: Structured periodized training showed measurable changes in my data—distance trends shifted, heart rate dropped at consistent paces. Research confirms what the patterns revealed.

Unexpected benefit: Seeing accumulated effort over months provides motivation that daily notifications can't match.

Shared the project on GitHub for others with Garmin data who want to see their training in context. Read the full analysis.
