## Screenshots Needed

1. **Distance over time with trend line**
   - Shows long-term progression
   - Illustrates run vs walk intervals
   - Displays trend line showing improvement

2. **Training events marked on timeline**
   - Demonstrates context features
   - Shows how events correlate with performance

3. **Before/after trend comparison**
   - Illustrates impact of structured training
   - Shows slope change in distance or pace trends

## Quote Card Suggestions

Choose one for social media:

**Option 1:**
"Fitness apps want you to check daily. Real fitness happens slowly."

**Option 2:**
"It's not another badge you need. It's seeing the work you've already accumulated."

**Option 3:**
"Week-to-week progress is a myth. Training shows results over months."

**Option 4:**
"Individual run metrics mean nothing without seeing the bigger picture over time."

**Option 5:**
"Don't let code intimidate you. AI tools like Claude can help you understand and adapt the dashboard."
