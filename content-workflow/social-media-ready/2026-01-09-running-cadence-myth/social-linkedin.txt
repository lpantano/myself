Dug into Garmin's cadence zone documentation. Found something revealing.

Those color zones? Percentile rankings comparing you to all Garmin users. Fixed thresholds: orange = 5th-29th percentile, green = 30th-69th.

The problem: Garmin's manual acknowledges "taller runners typically have slightly slower cadences." Yet the algorithm doesn't adjust for height, pace, or individual biomechanics.

Research shows 50% of cadence variation is unmeasurable individual factors. Every inch of height = ~3 fewer steps per minute. Elite runners vary from 155-203 spm and perform equally.

This is how data gets misinterpreted: not from wrong numbers, but from misunderstanding what the numbers measure.

Percentile rankings ≠ personal optimization. Context always matters.
