Your Garmin says orange zone. You think: something's wrong with my running form.

Here's what it really means: you're in the 5th-29th percentile compared to other Garmin users.

Not optimized for your body. Just ranked against everyone else.

The kicker? Garmin's own manual admits taller runners have slower cadences—but the zones don't adjust for height.

Research shows 50% of cadence is unmeasurable individual factors. You're being compared to a population average that ignores what makes you, you.

If you're in orange/green and feel good, you're fine.
