# Validation Questions

## Question 1: Does the post clearly explain the problem this solution solves?

**Answer:**
Yes. The post establishes that manual paper reviews suffer from inconsistency—reviewers might thoroughly check conflicts of interest in one review but forget in another. This lack of consistency undermines scientific evaluation. The problem is concrete (30min-2hr reviews with variable quality) and relatable to anyone doing systematic work.

**Refinement needed:**
The problem section is clear. Consider emphasizing earlier that this affects not just efficiency but scientific validity of the entire project.

## Question 2: Can a reader unfamiliar with Claude custom commands understand how to create their own?

**Answer:**
Partially. The post shows the structure (input/task/output) and provides two examples (paper review and nextflow optimization), but doesn't walk through the actual markdown syntax or file setup in detail. Someone would need to reference the Claude documentation to actually build one.

**Refinement needed:**
Add a brief "Quick Start" section showing the actual markdown structure with a minimal example. Balance between tutorial and overview—this is a blog post, not full documentation, but readers should be able to start immediately.

## Question 3: Does the content demonstrate real value without overstating AI capabilities?

**Answer:**
Yes. The post explicitly states "The custom command doesn't replace my judgment—it retrieves information and ensures I evaluate every paper the same way." The value proposition is clear: consistency and thoroughness, not replacement of human expertise. The real example (raspberry leaf study) shows both what the AI does and where human decision-making remains essential.

**Refinement needed:**
The balance is good. Consider adding one sentence about limitations—what custom commands can't do or where they might struggle—to maintain credibility.
