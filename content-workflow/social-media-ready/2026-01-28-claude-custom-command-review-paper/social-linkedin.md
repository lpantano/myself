I had to review **100+ papers** for the Health Integrity Project in one month. After realizing I kept forgetting steps, I built **custom AI commands** that run the same checks every time—conflicts, quality criteria, everything.

Now each review takes **30 minutes** and nothing gets missed. Sharing the approach in case you're doing any repetitive analysis work.
